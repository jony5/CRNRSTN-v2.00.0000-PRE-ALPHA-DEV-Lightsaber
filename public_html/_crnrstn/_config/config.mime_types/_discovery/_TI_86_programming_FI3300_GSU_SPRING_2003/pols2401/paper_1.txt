Brainstorm:

Argument In theory...
Argument in practice...

Depends on the defintion of State sovereignity one chooses to use... "Choose" 
because depending on the context, there are a few legit definitions of 
State Sovereignity.

	§	Sovereignty: the principle that the state exercises absolute 
		and exclusive power and authority over its territory, 
		population and system of government

******************************************************************
Positive Sovereignty refers to states which:
-	Are recognized by other states, the int’l community
-	Have the capacity to exercise effective power within their own territories
-	Are able to defend themselves against external attacks

Negative Sovereignty refers to states which:
-	Are recognized by other states, the int’l community (= juridical sovereignty)
-	Do not have the capacity to exercise effective power within their own 
	territories
-	Are unable to defend themselves against external attacks (= quasi/failed 
	states)
*****************************************************************

In the Post-Cold War world, globalization and interdependence force nation-states 
to progressively surrender sovereignty over certain key areas:
-	International trade
-	International Monetary and financial relations
-	International environment (Global Warming: Kyoto Protocol, 1997-98, 
	contains legally binding emissions targets for key greenhouse gases)
*****************************************************************
II.	Types of Nationalism (2)
1.	Civic Nationalism
a.	Civic Nationalism: the first and oldest type initially associated with 
	Western European or North American politics
b.	Seen as a “legal-political concept” or as a “political configuration”
Note:	- the revolutions (Napoleon) are important milestones on the path to democracy.  They resulted in the breaking of the stranglehold on political power of the kings and aristocrats…Still however, it is possible for these civic nationalism to result in exclusion (cite U.S. constitution and women/minorities)
Note: - Most scholars who deal with nationalism believe that the growth of 
	nationalism is a fundamental aspect of modernization that involves 
	industrialization, urbanization, increased literacy, and secularization

2.	Ethnic Nationalism
a.	Ethnic Nationalism: Originally associated with countries in Eastern and 
	central Europe
b.	Based on ancestral association
i.	By definition then it requires a common culture, way of life, and above all 
	a perceived sense of genetic links among the members
[Note: While all forms of nationalism are exclusionary…the presence of borders and 
	frontiers…ethnic nationalism is far more exclusionary than civic and pays less attention to political boundaries]
*****************************************************************
Similarities between the 2 forms of Nationalism:
-	Sense of belonging
-	Desire for political independence
-	Foster popular sovereignty (for democracy)

Functions (5):
1.	Identification
2.	Centrifugal force: breaking up of falsely formed associations
3.	Centripetal force: Joining of smaller groups
4.	Mobilization: militarily
5.	Resistance: border protection

Negative Aspects of Nationalism (4):
1.	Imperialism
2.	Glorification of the state
3.	Creation of enemies
4.	Discrimination against minorities
5.	Competing rights
6.	Overlap with religion
***************************************************************
Evolution of the Nation-State System				1.22.2003

The State: A legal-political entity that has a government exercising supreme 
authority over:
-	A given population
-	A well-defined territory/territorial boundaries
-	Acknowledging no higher authority (i.e. sovereignty)

This government is endowed with legal status in international law, because it is 
recognized by other states.

Note: a major principle of international law is that of the equality of states, 
regardless of their power, size, population etc.
**************************************************************
Paradigm: A widely accepted theoretical orientation shared by the scholarly 
community at a  particular time; a particular way of seeing the world. [Note: when 
the commonly-held view seems increasingly at odds with empirical evidence [reality], 
a competing paradigm may emerge to challenge the established one, which may lead
to a revolution in the field.  Paradigms help us make sense of the complexity of 
international affairs.
**************************************************************
Political Idealist/Idealism:
-	A theory/paradigm based on certain assumptions:
o	Human Nature is essentially good and therefore if there are problems, 
	they are due not to the fact that people are bad, but that there are bad 
	institutions, so what you need to do
o	War is not inevitable, it can be avoided through multilateral diplomacy, 
	collective security; League of Nations, NATO
*************************************************************
Political Realism:
1.	Think that human nature is naturally bad, motivated by greed…
2.	The Nation-State is seen as the main unit of denomination…
3.	International politics is basically struggle for power, i.e. national 
	interest
Realist Paradigm (human nature is evil | states motivated by power):
-	States are key actors
-	View international organizations as extensions/pawns of the states
-	Non-governmental are considered to be even less
-	States behave as rational actors pursuing their national interest…national 
	security
o	National Interest
§	Core
·	National Security
·	Territorial integrity
§	Vital/secondary
·	Economic
·	Social
·	Cultural
·	Human Rights
o	Security Dilemma…free for all…no central government
o	Collective Security
§	1815- Concert of Europe/Congress of Vienna
************************************************************

Realist position:
	Challenges the notion that states behave as rational actors pursuing their 
	national interest…primarily national security
	The focus should not be states but individuals who make the decisions.

Nation-states are experiencing a crisis of authority…forced to address certain 
	needs of their society...Social Security, education… but at the same time 
	their capacity to address those needs is being reduced b/c all government 
	are being asked to reduce government expenditures, forced to reduce 
	taxation, privatization…

Assumpotion#3:  It challenges the view that because of the decentralized nature 
	of the int’l system interstate relations are likely to be characterized by 
	conflict, including armed conflict
