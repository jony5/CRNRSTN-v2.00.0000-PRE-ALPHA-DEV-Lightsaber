POLS Notes:

GEorge Bush Sr.

	1. Universal comitment to the internat'l law
	2. This new world order should be based on the peaceful settlement of 
	   disputes in int'l affairs.

Two WOrld Views:

Optimistic:	Book "The End of History, 1989" (by Henry Fukuyama)...a certain type of 
		human history has ended..
			- Triumph of western liberal democracy and capitalism
			  over the "-isms"

Pessimistic:	Professor of Gov't at Harvard...Samuel Huntington's book: "The clash
		of Civilizations", 1986
			- conflict among states is no loger based on idealogy or
			  politics...new line of conflict is between culture, civilizations,
			  religions....western stuff vs. all the others(Islamic culture/religion in particular)

		"The Coming of Anarchy" by Robert Kaplan
			- the post cold war world is a very unstable world...new conflicts emerging
			  after the world war...religious, ecoogical...

The International System:

	- A concept of int'l relations...

	- Refers to the INternational actors themselves, and to the interaction between these actors.

		International Actors: 	1) State or sovereign Nation States

	- During the Cold war, it was a Bipolar System
		(i.e. a systems wiht 2 main centers of power)
		However the Non-aligned movement(NAM) formed by Southern (third world) states tried to have neutrality

			* then Japan-->EU-->China
