<P>SIX PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL REALISM</P></FONT>
<P>1.Political realism believes that politics, like society in general, is 
governed by objective laws that have their roots in human nature. In order to 
improve society it is first necessary to understand the laws by which society 
lives. The operation of these laws being impervious to our preferences, men will 
challenge them only at the risk of failure.</P>
<P>Realism, believing as it does in the objectivity of the laws of politics, 
must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory that 
reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believes 
also, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and 
opinion-between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence 
and illuminated by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from 
the facts as they are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking.</P>
<P>Human nature, in which the laws of politics have their roots, has not changed 
since the classical philosophies of China, India, and Greece endeavored to 
discover these laws. Hence, novelty is not necessarily a virtue in political 
theory, nor is old age a defect. The fact that a theory of politics, if there be 
such a theory, has never been heard of before tends to create a presumption 
against, rather than in favor of, its soundness. Conversely, the fact that a 
theory of politics was developed hundreds or even thousands of years ag~as was 
the theory of the balance of power-does not create a presumption that it must be 
outmoded and obsolete. A theory of politics must be subjected to the dual test 
of reason and experience. To dismiss such a theory because it had its flowering 
in centuries past is to present not a rational argument but a modernistic 
prejudice that takes for granted the superiority of the present over the past. 
To dispose of the revival of such a theory as a "fashion" or "fad" is tantamount 
to assuming that in matters political we can have opinions but no truths.</P>
<P>For realism, theory consists in ascertaining facts and giving them meaning 
through reason. It assumes that the character of a foreign policy can be 
ascertained only through the examination of the political acts performed and of 
the foreseeable consequences of these acts. Thus we can find out what statesmen 
have actually done, and from the foreseeable consequences of their acts we can 
surmise what their objectives might have been.</P>
<P>Yet examination of the facts is not enough. To give meaning to the factual 
raw material of foreign policy, we must approach political reality with a kind 
of rational outline, a map that suggests to us the possible meanings of foreign 
policy. In other words, we put ourselves in the position of a statesman who must 
meet a certain problem of foreign policy under certain circumstances, and we ask 
ourselves what the rational alternatives are from which a statesman may choose 
who must meet this problem under these circumstances (presuming always that he 
acts in a rational manner), and which of these rational alternatives this 
particular statesman, acting under these circumstances, is likely to choose. It 
is the testing of this rational hypothesis against the actual facts and their 
consequences that gives theoretical meaning to the facts of international 
politics.</P>
<P>2. The main signpost that helps political realism to find its way through the 
landscape of international politics is the concept of interest defined in terms 
of power. This concept provides the link between reason trying to understand 
international politics and the facts to be understood. It sets politics as an 
autonomous sphere of action and understanding apart from other spheres, such as 
economics (understood in terms of interest defined as wealth), ethics, 
aesthetics, or religion. Without such a concept a theory of politics, 
international or domestic, would be altogether impossible, for without it we 
could not distinguish between political and nonpolitical facts, nor could we 
bring at least a measure of systematic order to the political sphere.</P>
<P>We assume that statesmen think and act in terms of interest defined as power, 
and the evidence of history bears that assumption out. That assumption allows us 
to retrace and anticipate, as it were, the steps a statesman-past, present, or 
future~has taken or will take on the political scene. We look over his shoulder 
when he writes his dispatches; we listen in on his conversation with other 
statesmen; we read and anticipate his very thoughts. Thinking in terms of 
interest defined as power, we think as he does, and as disinterested observers 
we understand his thoughts and actions perhaps better than he, the actor on the 
political scene, does himself.</P>
<P>The concept of interest defined as power imposes intellectual discipline upon 
the observer, infuses rational order into the subject matter of politics, and 
thus makes the theoretical understanding of politics possible. On the side of 
the actor, it provides for rational discipline in action and creates that 
astounding continuity in foreign policy which makes American, British, or 
Russian foreign policy appear as an intelligible, rational continuum, by and 
large consistent within itself, regardless of the different motives, 
preferences, and intellectual and moral qualities of successive statesmen. A 
realist theory of international politics, then, will guard against two popular 
fallacies: the concern with motives and the concern with ideological 
preferences.</P>
<P>To search for the clue to foreign policy exclusively in the motives of 
statesmen is both futile and deceptive. It is futile because motives are the 
most illusive of psychological data, distorted as they are, frequently beyond 
recognition, by the interests and emotions of actor and observer alike. Do we 
really know what our own motives are? And what do we know of the motives of 
others?</P>
<P>Yet even if we had access to the real motives of statesmen, that knowledge 
would help us little in understanding foreign policies, and might well lead us 
astray. It is true that the knowledge of the statesman's motives may give us one 
among many clues as to what the direction of his foreign policy might be. It 
cannot give us, however, the one clue by which to predict his foreign policies. 
History shows no exact and necessary correlation between the quality of motives 
and the quality of foreign policy. This is true in both moral and political 
terms.</P>
<P>We cannot conclude from the good intentions of a statesman that his foreign 
policies will be either morally praiseworthy or politically successful. Judging 
his motives, we can say that he will not intentionally pursue policies that are 
morally wrong, but we can say nothing about the probability of their success. If 
we want to know the moral and political qualities of his actions, we must know 
them, not his motives. How often have statesmen been motivated by the desire to 
improve the world, and ended by making it worse? And how often have they sought 
one goal, and ended by achieving something they neither expected nor 
desired?</P>
<P>Neville Chamberlain's politics of appeasement were, as far as we can judge, 
inspired by good motives; he was probably less motivated by considerations of 
personal power than were many other British prime ministers, and he sought to 
preserve peace and to assure the happiness of all concerned. Yet his policies 
helped to make the Second World War inevitable, and to bring untold miseries to 
millions of men. Sir Winston Churchill's motives, on the other hand, were much 
less universal in scope and much more narrowly directed toward personal and 
national power, yet the foreign policies that sprang from these inferior motives 
were certainly superior in moral and political quality to those pursued by his 
predecessor. Judged by his motives, Robespierre was one of the most virtuous men 
who ever lived. Yet it was the utopian radicalism of that very virtue that made 
him kill those less virtuous than himself, brought him to the scaffold, and 
destroyed the revolution of which he was a leader.</P>
<P>Good motives give assurance against deliberately bad policies; they do not 
guarantee the moral goodness and political success of the policies they inspire. 
What is important to know, if one wants to understand foreign policy, is not 
primarily the motives of a statesman, but his intellectual ability to comprehend 
the essentials of foreign policy, as well as his political ability to translate 
what he has comprehended into successful political action. It follows that while 
ethics in the abstract judges the moral qualities of motives, political theory 
must judge the political qualities of intellect, will, and action.</P>
<P>A realist theory of international politics will also avoid the other popular 
fallacy of equating the foreign policies of a statesman with his philosophic or 
political sympathies, and of deducing the former from the latter. Statesmen, 
especially under contemporary conditions, may well make a habit of presenting 
their foreign policies in terms of their philosophic and political sympathies in 
order to gain popular support for them. Yet they will distinguish with Lincoln 
between their <I>"o~dal </I>duty," which is to think and act in terms of the 
national interest, and their <I>"personal </I>wish," which is to see their own 
moral values and political principles realized throughout the world. Political 
realism does not require, nor does it condone, indifference to political ideals 
and moral principles, but it requires indeed a sharp distinction between the 
desirable and the possible-between what is desirable everywhere and at all times 
and what is possible under the concrete circumstances of time and place.</P>
<P>It stands to reason that not all foreign policies have always followed so 
rational, objective, and unemotional a course. The contingent elements of 
personality, prejudice, and subjective preference, and of all the weaknesses of 
intellect and will which flesh is heir to, are bound to deflect foreign policies 
from their rational course. Especially where foreign policy is conducted under 
the conditions of democratic control, the need to marshal popular emotions to 
the support of foreign policy cannot fail to impair the rationality of foreign 
policy itself. Yet a theory of foreign policy which aims at rationality must for 
the time being, as it were, abstract from these irrational elements and seek to 
paint a picture of foreign policy which presents the rational essence to be 
found in experience, without the contingent deviations from rationality which 
are also found in experience.</P>
<P>Deviations from rationality which are not the result of the personal whim or 
the personal psychopathology of the policy maker may appear contingent only from 
the vantage point of rationality, but may themselves be elements in a coherent 
system of irrationality. The conduct of the Indochina War by the United States 
suggests that possibility. It is a question worth looking into whether modern 
psychology and psychiatry have provided us with the conceptual tools which would 
enable us to construct, as it were, a counter-theory of irrational politics, a 
kind of pathology of international politics.</P>
<P>The experience of the Indochina War suggests five factors such a theory might 
encompass: the imposition upon the empirical world of a simplistic and a 
<I>priori </I>picture of the world derived from folklore and ideological 
assumption, that is, the replacement of experience with superstition; the 
refusal to correct this picture of the world in the light of experience; the 
persistence in a foreign policy derived from the misperception of reality and 
the use of intelligence for the purpose not of adapting policy to reality but of 
reinterpreting reality to fit policy; the egotism of the policy makers widening 
the gap between perception and policy, on the one hand, and reality, on the 
other; finally, the urge to close the gap at least subjectively by action, any 
kind of action, that creates the illusion of mastery over a recalcitrant 
reality. According to the <I>Wall Street Journal </I>of April 3, 1970, "the 
desire to 'do something' pervades top levels of Government and may overpower 
other 'common sense' advice that insists the U.S. ability to shape events is 
negligible. The yen for action could lead to bold policy as therapy."</P>
<P>The difference between international politics as it actually is and a 
rational theory derived from it is like the difference between a photograph and 
a painted portrait. The photograph shows everything that can be seen by the 
naked eye; the painted portrait does not show everything that can be seen by the 
naked eye, but it shows, or at least seeks to show, one thing that the naked eye 
cannot see: the human essence of the person portrayed.</P>
<P>Political realism contains not only a theoretical but also a normative 
element. It knows that political reality is replete with contingencies and 
systemic irrationalities and points to the typical influences they exert upon 
foreign policy. Yet it shares with all social theory the need, for the sake of 
theoretical understanding, to stress the rational elements of political reality; 
for it is these rational elements that make reality intelligible for theory. 
Political realism presents the theoretical construct of a rational foreign 
policy which experience can never completely achieve.</P>
<P>At the same time political realism considers a rational foreign policy to be 
good foreign policy; for only a rational foreign policy minimizes risks and 
maximizes benefits and, hence, complies both with the moral precept of prudence 
and the political requirement of success. Political realism wants the 
photographic picture of the political world to resemble as much as possible its 
painted portrait. Aware of the inevitable gap between good—that is, 
rational—foreign policy and foreign policy as it actually is, political realism 
maintains not only that theory must focus upon the rational elements of 
political reality, but also that foreign policy ought to be rational in view of 
its own moral and practical purposes.</P>
<P>Hence, it is no argument against the theory here presented that actual 
foreign policy does not or cannot live up to it. That argument misunderstands 
the intention of this book, which is to present not an indiscriminate 
description of political reality, but a rational theory of international 
politics. Far from being invalidated by the fact that, for instance, a perfect 
balance of power policy will scarcely be found in reality, it assumes that 
reality, being deficient in this respect, must be understood and evaluated as an 
approximation to an ideal system of balance of power.</P>
<P>3. Realism assumes that its key concept of interest defined as power is an 
objective category which is universally valid, but it does not endow that 
concept with a meaning that is fixed once and for all. The idea of interest is 
indeed of the essence of politics and is unaffected by the circumstances of time 
and place. Thucydides' statement, born of the experiences of ancient Greece, 
that "identity of interests is the surest of bonds whether between states or 
individuals" was taken up in the nineteenth century by Lord Salisbury's remark 
that "the only bond of union that endures" among nations is "the absence of all 
clashing interests." It was erected into a general principle of government by 
George Washington:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>A small knowledge of human nature will convince us, that, with far the 
    greatest part of mankind, interest is the governing principle; and that 
    almost every man is more or less, under its influence. Motives of public 
    virtue may for a time, or in particular instances, actuate men to the 
    observance of a conduct purely disinterested; but they are not of themselves 
    sufficient to produce persevering conformity to the refined dictates and 
    obligations of social duty. Few men are capable of making a continual 
    sacrifice of all views of private interest, or advantage, to the common 
    good. It is vain to exclaim against the depravity of human nature on this 
    account; the fact is so, the experience of every age and nation has proved 
    it and we must in a great measure, change the constitution of man, before we 
    can make it otherwise. No institution, not built on the presumptive truth of 
    these maxims can succeed.<SUP></P></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It was echoed and enlarged upon in our century by Max Weber's 
observation:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Interests (material and ideal), not ideas, dominate directly the actions 
    of men. Yet the "images of the world" created by these ideas have very often 
    served as switches determining the tracks on which the dynamism of interests 
    kept actions moving.<SUP></P></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Yet the kind of interest determining political action in a particular period 
of history depends upon the political and cultural context within which foreign 
policy is formulated. The goals that might be pursued by nations in their 
foreign policy can run the whole gamut of objectives any nation has ever pursued 
or might possibly pursue.</P>
<P>The same observations apply to the concept of power. Its content and the 
manner of its use are determined by the political and cultural environment. 
Power may comprise anything that establishes and maintains the control of man 
over man. Thus power covers all social relationships which serve that end, from 
physical violence to the most subtle psychological ties by which one mind 
controls another. Power covers the domination of man by man, both when it is 
disciplined by moral ends and controlled by constitutional safeguards, as in 
Western democracies, and when it is that untamed and barbaric force which finds 
its laws in nothing but its own strength and its sole justification in its 
aggrandizement.</P>
<P>Political realism does not assume that the contemporary conditions under 
which foreign policy operates, with their extreme instability and the ever 
present threat of large-scale violence, cannot be changed. The balance of power, 
for instance, is indeed a perennial element of all pluralistic societies, as the 
authors of <I>The Federalist </I>papers well knew; yet it is capable of 
operating, as it does in the United States, under the conditions of relative 
stability and peaceful conflict. If the factors that have given rise to these 
conditions can be duplicated on the international scene, similar conditions of 
stability and peace will then prevail there, as they have over long stretches of 
history among certain nations.</P>
<P>What is true of the general character of international relations is also true 
of the nation state as the ultimate point of reference of contemporary foreign 
policy. While the realist indeed believes that interest is the perennial 
standard by which political action must be judged and directed, the contemporary 
connection between interest and the nation state is a product of history, and is 
therefore bound to disappear in the course of history. Nothing in the realist 
position militates against the assumption that the present division of the 
political world into nation states will be replaced by larger units of a quite 
different character, more in keeping with the technical potentialities and the 
moral requirements of the contemporary world.</P>
<P>The realist parts company with other schools of thought before the 
all-important question of how the contemporary world is to be transformed. The 
realist is persuaded that this transformation can be achieved only through the 
workmanlike manipulation of the perennial forces that have shaped the past as 
they will the future. The realist cannot be persuaded that we can bring about 
that transformation by confronting a political reality that has its own laws 
with an abstract ideal that refuses to take those laws into account.</P>
<P>4. Political realism is aware of the moral significance of political action. 
It is also aware of the ineluctable tension between the moral command and the 
requirements of successful political action. And it is unwilling to gloss over 
and obliterate that tension and thus to obfuscate both the moral and the 
political issue by making it appear as though the stark facts of politics were 
morally more satisfying than they actually are, and the moral law less exacting 
than it actually is.</P>
<P>Realism maintains that universal moral principles cannot be applied to the 
actions of states in their abstract universal formulation, but that they must be 
filtered through the concrete circumstances of time and place. The individual 
may say for himself: <I>"Fiat justitia, pereat mundus </I>(Let justice be done, 
even if the world perish)," but the state has no right to say so in the name of 
those who are in its care. Both individual and state must judge political action 
by universal moral principles, such as that of liberty. Yet while the individual 
has a moral right to sacrifice himself in defense of such a moral principle, the 
state has no right to let its moral disapprobation of the infringement of 
liberty get in the way of successful political action, itself inspired by the 
moral principle of national survival. There can be no political morality without 
prudence; that is, without consideration of the political consequences of 
seemingly moral action. Realism, then, considers prudence-the weighing of the 
consequences of alternative political actions-to be the supreme virtue in 
politics. Ethics in the abstract judges action by its conformity with the moral 
law; political ethics judges action by its political consequences. Classical and 
medieval philosophy knew this, and so did Lincoln when he said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>I do the very best I know how, the very best I can, and I mean to keep 
    doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is said 
    against me won't amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten 
    angels swearing I was right would make no 
difference.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>5. Political realism refuses to identify the moral aspirations of a 
particular nation with the moral laws that govern the universe. As it 
distinguishes between truth and opinion, so it distinguishes between truth and 
idolatry. All nations are tempted-and few have been able to resist the 
temptation for long-to clothe their own particular aspirations and actions in 
the moral purposes of the universe. To know that nations are subject to the 
moral law is one thing, while to pretend to know with certainty what is good and 
evil in the relations among nations is quite another. There is a world of 
difference between the belief that all nations stand under the judgment of God, 
inscrutable to the human mind, and the blasphemous conviction that God is always 
on one's side and that what one wills oneself cannot fail to be willed by God 
also.</P>
<P>The lighthearted equation between a particular nationalism and the counsels 
of Providence is morally indefensible, for it is that very sin of pride against 
which the Greek tragedians and the Biblical prophets have warned rulers and 
ruled. That equation is also politically pernicious, for it is liable to 
engender the distortion in judgment which, in the blindness of crusading frenzy, 
destroys nations and civilizations-in the name of moral principle, ideal, or God 
himself.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it is exactly the concept of interest defined in terms of 
power that saves us from both that moral excess and that political folly. For if 
we look at all nations, our own included, as political entities pursuing their 
respective interests defined in terms of power, we are able to do justice to all 
of them. And we are able to do justice to all of them in a dual sense: We are 
able to judge other nations as we judge our own and, having judged them in this 
fashion, we are then capable of pursuing policies that respect the interests of 
other nations, while protecting and promoting those of our own. Moderation in 
policy cannot fail to reflect the moderation of moral judgment.</P>
<P>6. The difference, then, between political realism and other schools of 
thought is real, and it is profound. However much the theory of political 
realism may have been misunderstood and misinterpreted, there is no gainsaying 
its distinctive intellectual and moral attitude to matters political.</P>
<P>Intellectually, the political realist maintains the autonomy of the political 
sphere, as the economist, the lawyer, the moralist maintain theirs. He thinks in 
terms of interest defined as power, as the economist thinks in terms of interest 
defined as wealth; the lawyer, of the conformity of action with legal rules; the 
moralist, of the conformity of action with moral principles. The economist asks: 
"How does this policy affect the wealth of society, or a segment of it?" The 
lawyer asks: "Is this policy in accord with the rules of law?" The moralist 
asks: "Is this policy in accord with moral principles?" And the political 
realist asks: "How does this policy affect the power of the nation?" (Or of the 
federal government, of Congress, of the party, of agriculture, as the case may 
be.)</P>
<P>The political realist is not unaware of the existence and relevance of 
standards of thought other than political ones. As political realist, he cannot 
but subordinate these other standards to those of politics. And he parts company 
with other schools when they impose standards of thought appropriate to other 
spheres upon the political sphere. It is here that political realism takes issue 
with the "legalistic-moralistic approach" to international politics. That this 
issue is not, as has been contended, a mere figment of the imagination, but goes 
to the very core of the controversy, can be shown from many historical examples. 
Three will suffice to make the point.<SUP>3</P></SUP>
<P>In 1939 the Soviet Union attacked Finland. This action confronted France and 
Great Britain with two issues, one legal, the other political. Did that action 
violate the Covenant of the League of Nations and, if it did, what 
countermeasures should France and Great Britain take? The legal question could 
easily be answered in the affirmative, for obviously the Soviet Union had done 
what was prohibited by the Covenant. The answer to the political question 
depends, first, upon the manner in which the Russian action affected the 
interests of France and Great Britain; second, upon the existing distribution of 
power between France and Great Britain, on the one hand, and the Soviet Union 
and other potentially hostile nations, especially Germany, on the other; and, 
third, upon the influence that the countermeasures were likely to have upon the 
interests of France and Great Britain and the future distribution of power. 
France and Great Britain, as the leading members of the League of Nations, saw 
to it that the Soviet Union was expelled from the League, and they were 
prevented from joining Finland in the war against the Soviet Union only by 
Sweden's refusal to allow their troops to pass through Swedish territory on 
their way to Finland. If this refusal by Sweden had not saved them, France and 
Great Britain would shortly have found themselves at war with the Soviet Union 
and Germany at the same time.</P>
<P>The policy of France and Great Britain was a classic example of legalism in 
that they allowed the answer to the legal question, legitimate within its 
sphere, to determine their political actions. Instead of asking both questions, 
that of law and that of power, they asked only the question of law; and the 
answer they received could have no bearing on the issue that their very 
existence might have depended upon.</P>
<P>The second example illustrates the "moralistic approach" to international 
politics. It concerns the international status of the Communist government of 
China. The rise of that government confronted the Western world with two issues, 
one moral, the other political. Were the nature and policies of that government 
in accord with the moral principles of the Western world? Should the Western 
world deal with such a government? The answer to the first question could not 
fail to be in the negative. Yet it did not follow with necessity that the answer 
to the second question should also be in the negative. The standard of thought 
applied to the first</P>
<P>--the moral question—was simply to test the nature and the policies of the 
Communist government of China by the principles of Western morality. On the 
other hand, the second—the political question—had to be subjected to the 
complicated test of the interests involved and the power available on either 
side, and of the bearing of one or the other course of action upon these 
interests and power. The application of this test could well have led to the 
conclusion that it would be wiser not to deal with the Communist government of 
China. To arrive at this conclusion by neglecting this test altogether and 
answering the political question in terms of the moral issue was indeed a 
classic example of the "moralistic approach" to international politics.</P>
<P>The third case illustrates strikingly the contrast between realism and the 
legalistic-moralistic approach to foreign policy. Great Britain, as one of the 
guarantors of the neutrality of Belgium, went to war with Germany in August 1914 
because Germany had violated the neutrality of Belgium. The British action could 
be justified either in realistic or legalistic-moralistic terms. That is to say, 
one could argue realistically that for centuries it had -been axiomatic for 
British foreign policy to prevent the control of the Low Countries by a hostile 
power. It was then not so much the violation of Belgium's neutrality per se as 
the hostile intentions of the violator which provided the rationale for British 
intervention. If the violator had been another nation but Germany, Great Britain 
might well have refrained from intervening. This is the position taken by Sir 
Edward Grey, British Foreign Secretary during that period. Under Secretary for 
Foreign Affairs Hardinge remarked to him in 1908: "If France violated Belgian 
neutrality in a war against Germany, it is doubtful whether England or Russia 
would move a finger to maintain Belgian neutrality, while if the neutrality of 
Belgium was violated by Germany, it is probable that the converse would be the 
case." Whereupon Sir Edward Grey replied: "This is to the point." Yet one could 
also take the legalistic and moralistic position that the violation of Belgium's 
neutrality per se, because of its legal and moral defects and regardless of the 
interests at stake and of the identity of the violator, justified British and, 
for that matter, American intervention. This was the position which Theodore 
Roosevelt took in his letter to Sir Edward Grey of January 22, 1915:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>To me the crux of the situation has been Belgium. If England or France 
    had acted toward Belgium as Germany has acted I should have opposed them, 
    exactly as I now oppose Germany. I have emphatically approved your action as 
    a model for what should be done by those who believe that treaties should be 
    observed in good faith and that there is such a thing as international 
    morality. I take this position as an American who is no more an Englishman 
    than he is a German, who endeavors loyally to serve the interests of his own 
    country, but who also endeavors to do what he can for justice and decency as 
    regards mankind at large, and who therefore feels obliged to judge all other 
    nations by their conduct on any given occasion.</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This realist defense of the autonomy of the political sphere against its 
subversion by other modes of thought does not imply disregard for the existence 
and importance of these other modes of thought. It rather implies that each 
should be assigned its proper sphere and function. Political realism is based 
upon a pluralistic conception of human nature. Real man is a composite of 
"economic man," "political man," "moral man," "religious man," etc. A man who 
was nothing but "political man" would be a beast, for he would be completely 
lacking in moral restraints. A man who was nothing but "moral man" would be a 
fool, for he would be completely lacking in prudence. A man who was nothing but 
"religious man" would be a saint, for he would be completely lacking in worldly 
desires.</P>
<P>Recognizing that these different facets of human nature exist, political 
realism also recognizes that in order to understand one of them one has to deal 
with it on its own terms. That is to say, if I want to understand "religious 
man," I must for the time being abstract from the other aspects of human nature 
and deal with its religious aspect as if it were the only one. Furthermore, I 
must apply to the religious sphere the standards of thought appropriate to it, 
always remaining aware of the existence of other standards and their actual 
influence upon the religious qualities of man. What is true of this facet of 
human nature is true of all the others. No modern economist, for instance, would 
conceive of his science and its relations to other sciences of man in any other 
way. It is exactly through such a process of emancipation from other standards 
of thought, and the development of one appropriate to its subject matter, that 
economics has developed as an autonomous theory of the economic activities of 
man. To contribute to a similar development in the field of politics is indeed 
the purpose of political realism.</P>
<P>It is in the nature of things that a theory of politics which is based upon 
such principles will not meet with unanimous approval-nor does, for that matter, 
such a foreign policy. For theory and policy alike run counter to two trends in 
our culture which are not able to reconcile themselves to the assumptions and 
results of a rational, objective theory of politics. One of these trends 
disparages the role of power in society on grounds that stem from the experience 
and philosophy of the nineteenth century; we shall address ourselves to this 
tendency later in greater detail.<SUP>4 </SUP>The other trend, opposed to the 
realist theory and practice of politics, stems from the very relationship that 
exists, and must exist, between the human mind and the political sphere. For 
reasons that we shall discuss later<SUP>5 </SUP>the human mind in its day-by-day 
operations cannot bear to look the truth of politics straight in the face. It 
must disguise, distort, belittle, and embellish the truth-the more so, the more 
the individual is actively involved in the processes of politics, and 
particularly in those of international politics. For only by deceiving himself 
about the nature of politics and the role he plays on the political scene is man 
able to live contentedly as a political animal with himself and his fellow 
men.</P>
<P>Thus it is inevitable that a theory which tries to understand international 
politics as it actually is and as it ought to be in view of its intrinsic 
nature, rather than as people would like to see it, must overcome a 
psychological resistance that most other branches of learning need not face. A 
book devoted to the theoretical understanding of international politics 
therefore requires a special explanation and justification.</P>
