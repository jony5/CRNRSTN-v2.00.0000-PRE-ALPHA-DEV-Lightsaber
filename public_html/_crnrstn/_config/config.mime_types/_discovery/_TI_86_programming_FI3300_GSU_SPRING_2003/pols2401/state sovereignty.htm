Papers, I:i</A><BR>© Feb. 2000 All rights reserved.<BR></FONT><B>
<P><FONT size=6>T</FONT></B>HE purpose of this very brief paper is to show that 
sovereignty, properly defined, is not a defence for breaches of gross violations 
of fundamental human rights. It has never been such, and today it is less a 
defence than ever. 
<P>For a long time (certainly until World War I, in fact up to 1945), human 
rights were part of the "reserved domain" of States, that is a matter which was 
"not, in principle, regulated by international law". However, even "[i]n such a 
case, jurisdiction which, in principle, belongs solely to the State, is limited 
by rules of international law". And the Permanent Court of International Justice 
recalled in this respect that "the jurisdiction of a State is <I>exclusive</I> 
<U>within the limits fixed by international law</U> -- using this expression in 
its wider sense, that is to say, embracing both customary law and general as 
well as particular treaty law"<SUP><FONT size=-1>1</FONT></SUP>. Therefore, 
State sovereignty must be interpreted in view of, and combined with, general 
principles of international law such as the general prohibition of abuses of 
rights, proportionality, respect of other States' sovereignty, due diligence, 
"minimum standards of civilisation", etc. 
<P>In other words, sovereignty is not -- and has never been -- an unlimited 
power to do all that is not expressly forbidden by international law<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>2</FONT></SUP>. It can only be defined as the very criterion of States, 
by virtue of which such an entity "possesses the totality of international 
rights and duties <I>recognized by international law</I>"<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>3</FONT></SUP> as long as it has not limited them in particular terms by 
concluding a treaty. 
<P>It goes without saying that, in modern times (say, since 1945), the large 
(but not unlimited) freedom of action traditionally belonging to States when 
dealing with human rights has been restricted in many respects: 
<UL>
  <LI>the Charter of the United Nations, even though it focuses mainly on 
  "keeping the peace" and not on human rights, nonetheless abounds in allusions 
  to "fundamental human rights"<SUP><FONT size=-1>4</FONT></SUP>; 
  <LI>at the regional as well as the global level, a great number of Conventions 
  have been adopted for the protection of human rights, either in general or 
  focusing on specific rights (against genocide, <I>apartheid</I>, torture, 
  etc.) or on particular categories of human beings (women, children, workers, 
  etc.); and 
  <LI>many of these rules protecting human rights have consolidated into 
  customary rules of international law, binding States whether they have 
  ratified those Conventions or not. </LI></UL>
<P>Another striking feature of this evolution is that this tight normative net 
is made up of legal rules of quite diverse binding nature: 
<UL>
  <LI>some are purely optional and bind only those States which have accepted 
  them by ratifying the relevant treaties (for example, rules protecting 
  workers, such as those at stake in the framework of the -- now dead? -- 
  "Millennium round"); 
  <LI>some are binding in a region or some regions, but clearly not at the 
  universal level (I would suggest that this is so concerning freedom of speech, 
  whether we like it or not); 
  <LI>or they are binding for all States, but they may be waived by an express 
  contrary treaty (this is probably so concerning some judicial rights -- this 
  category does not strongly differ from the previous one); but 
  <LI>others must be seen as "peremptory norms of general public international 
  law"<SUP><FONT size=-1>5</FONT></SUP> and these form the main part of the 
  famous (among international lawyers) <I>jus cogens</I>. </LI></UL>
<P>This makes of course quite a difference when a State violates a rule of human 
rights. Since there exists a hierarchy among international legal rules 
protecting human rights, their violation does not call for one uniform response; 
the kind of reaction expected from other States will vary according to the 
degree of "bindingness" of the violated rules. 
<P>Two things are crystal clear. First, when a State is not bound by a rule, its 
international responsibility is not "entailed" when it does not comply with the 
requirement of said rule. Second, human rights rules are, in this respect, of a 
particular nature since they are not "reciprocal". As the World Court put it in 
a celebrated <I>dictum</I> (relating to the 1948 Genocide Convention, but which, 
indeed, holds true for any other human rights treaty): "In such a convention, 
the contracting States do not have any interests of their own; they merely have, 
one and all, a common interest, namely, the accomplishment of those high 
purposes which are the <I>raison d'être</I> of the convention"<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>6</FONT></SUP>. Consequently, many of these human rights instruments 
provide for an international mechanism of implementation and control which can 
be used either by other States, acting as surrogate "international prosecutors" 
or, and this was the great revolution of the 1950 European Convention on H uman 
Rights even if it may seem "banal" nowadays, by individuals, whether they are 
nationals of the wrongdoing State or foreigners. 
<P>If such a mechanism does not exist -- or if a State does not comply with the 
requirements of such a mechanism when it does exist -- we are, nevertheless, 
sent back to general international law<SUP><FONT size=-1>7</FONT></SUP>. In 
other words, what if there is no international mechanism or if it exists but is 
impotent? Here, the hierarchy existing among human rights rules does matter. 
<P>If we are facing a violation of a "simply binding" human right (e.g.: the 
freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, the right to privacy, etc.), not 
much can be done, according to existing international law, if the victim is a 
national of the wrongdoing State -- except that other States, or international 
organisations (including NGOs) are entitled to make remonstrations and 
recommendations without being accused of "intervention in internal affairs". 
Human rights are no longer "internal affairs"; as explained above, they are not 
"essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any State" in the terms used by 
Article 2, paragraph 7 of the Charter of the United Nations. And the situation 
is not that much better if the victim is a foreigner, except that, besides the 
same possibilities, his or her national State may offer him or her its 
"diplomatic protection" and act on his or her behalf at the international level 
(including by lodging an application before an international court, if such a 
court has juris diction concerning disputes between the two States; but it will 
be rarely so... ). 
<P>Now, things are different if the violated human rights rule is not only 
merely "binding" upon the State, but also is of a "peremptory" nature. As a 
matter of definition, a peremptory rule is "a norm accepted and recognised by 
the international community of States as a whole as a norm for which no 
derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of 
general international law having the same character"<SUP><FONT 
size=-1>8</FONT></SUP>. This is important: as a matter of definition, these 
rules (and respect for these rules) are of concern for "the international 
community of States as a whole". As a consequence, the International Law 
Commission (ILC) of the UN, in its draft Articles concerning the international 
responsibility of States, has specified that, in such a case, "all other States" 
(not only the State whose national directly endures a prejudice) are "injured" 
by the internationally wrongful act thus committed, and it has called such a 
violation a "crime" under international law<SUP><FONT size=-1>9</FONT></SUP>. 
<P>In Article 19 of its draft, the ILC has defined a crime as being "[a]n 
internationally wrongful act which results from the breach of an obligation so 
essential for the protection of fundamental interests of the international 
community that its breach is recognised as a crime by that community as a 
whole". Among the examples of such State crimes, the ILC cites, e.g.: "a serious 
breach on a widespread scale of an obligation of essential importance for 
safeguarding the human being, such as those prohibiting slavery, genocide and 
<I>apartheid</I>"<SUP><FONT size=-1>10</FONT></SUP>. 
<P>This notion of crime is fruitful only if it has concrete consequences. And 
indeed it does. This is not the proper place to detail these 
consequences<SUP><FONT size=-1>11</FONT></SUP>; suffice it to enumerate the most 
important among them and to elaborate shortly about those which are of direct 
relevance for the present topic. In cases when a "crime" is committed by a 
State: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>all other States are under a double duty (a) "not to recognise as lawful 
  the situation created by the crime" and (b) "to cooperate with other States in 
  the application of measures designed to eliminate the consequences of the 
  crime"<SUP><FONT size=-1>12</FONT></SUP>; 
  <LI>all States may claim to have an interest to lodge claims before any 
  international available mechanism; a crime creates a possibility of an 
  <I>actio popularis</I> which normally does not exist under international 
  law<SUP><FONT size=-1>13</FONT></SUP>; 
  <LI>contrary to the usual fundamental principle prevailing in international 
  law, the "veil" constituted by the State can be pierced and the international 
  penal responsibility of the officials, including the Head of the State, is 
  entailed (this is not so for all other international wrongful acts committed 
  by a State: in these cases officials enjoy "jurisdictional immunities" -- the 
  ongoing <I>Pinochet</I> case is a striking example of what is at stake 
  here<SUP><FONT size=-1>14</FONT></SUP>); and 
  <LI>"counter-measures" (this is the new terminology for reprisals) can be 
  taken by all other States against the wrongdoer, and the conditions for these 
  counter-measures are considerably softened. </LI></OL>Is that to say that 
<I>any</I> kind of riposte is acceptable in such a case? My answer is clearly in 
the negative: a crime (i.e., a gross violation of a peremptory international 
norm) cannot be answered with the violation of another peremptory norm, that is 
another crime. And it happens that, in the modern world, the use of armed force 
is forbidden by such a norm, with two exceptions. Recourse to armed force is 
permissible: 
<OL type=a>
  <LI>in the framework of "the inherent right of individual or collective 
  self-defence" in case of an "armed attack"<SUP><FONT size=-1>15</FONT></SUP> 
  (an aggression); or 
  <LI>in compliance with a decision (or an authorisation) of the Security 
  Council of the United Nations acting in conformity with Chapter VII. </LI></OL>
<P>In short, and to put it into the terms of the well-known "Franco-French" 
debate popularised by Dr. Kouchner on the "<I>devoir ou droit 
d'ingérence</I>"<SUP><FONT size=-1>16</FONT></SUP>, there is, in the case of 
State crime (including gross violations of human rights) a right (and a duty) of 
intervention or, perhaps more properly said, a right (and a duty) of assistance 
to the victims; but this duty ends when unlawful use of armed force begins. 
<P>Now, let us apply this to the Kosovo case<SUP><FONT size=-1>17</FONT></SUP> 
in the form of brief conclusions: 
<OL type=i>
  <LI>a crime (that is, gross violations of human rights -- maybe a genocide, 
  certainly an <I>apartheid</I>) was being committed by the Government of 
  Yugoslavia against the Kosovar Albanian population; 
  <LI>all other States of the international community had a right and a duty to 
  react; 
  <LI>neither "sovereignty" nor the "principle of non-intervention" constitute a 
  defence; 
  <LI>on the other hand, NATO did not act out of self-defence, nor had the 
  Security Council authorised recourse to armed force by virtue of Chapter VII; 
  <LI>neither the fact that it declared the Kosovo situation as a "threat to the 
  peace"<SUP><FONT size=-1>18</FONT></SUP>, nor the rejection of the Russian 
  resolution condemning the NATO action are, by themselves, sufficient legal 
  grounds justifying this unilateral (or "plurilateral") recourse to armed 
  force; 
  <LI>however, it can be sustained that the addition of all these arguments 
  constitute quite an impressive pattern to exclude, at the end of the day, the 
  unlawfulness of the NATO action; 
  <LI>and, in any case, Resolution 1244 (1999) of the Security Council excludes 
  any doubt: indeed, it does not expressly give its blessing to the NATO action, 
  but it is inconceivable that the UN organ entailed with "the primary 
  responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and 
  security"<SUP><FONT size=-1>19</FONT></SUP> could have "recognised as lawful 
  the situation created by [a] crime"<SUP><FONT size=-1>20</FONT></SUP>, since, 
  if unlawful, the NATO action could only be described as a crime of aggression. 
  </LI></OL>
<P>This, indeed, opens new horizons and could lead to the conclusion that armed 
reactions to a State crime are permitted under international law. I would, 
however, not go as far as that: the Kosovo case remains an isolated precedent 
(and the East Timor or Chechenya dramas contradict it in a rather obvious way). 
However, it shows that the international community can at least tolerate an 
armed reaction against gross violations of human rights. The real problem now is 
to find a median solution between the morally untenable "Munich principle" and 
the legally embarrassing "Zorro principle", as practised by NATO in Kosovo. 
<P>At any rate, and I will conclude with this, since it answers, I think, the 
very question raised in the title of this paper: in cases of human rights 
violations, sovereignty is never a defence; in cases of gross violations of 
human rights, it has no role to play; it does not impede the Security Council 
from concluding that such violations create a threat to the peace and to draw 
the appropriate consequences in accordance with Chapter VII of the Charter; and 
it cannot even protect Heads of States from international prosecution.

criticised by some States (including the United States and France) and many

substantial progress towards recognizing community interest at the universal 
level, superseding national egos (see fn. 11, below). There is, however, a 
strong risk that, during the second reading of its draft on State

humanitarian catastrophe, whatever its causes, without having to request the 
consent of the territorial State. On this debate, see e.g. Mario Bettati and
