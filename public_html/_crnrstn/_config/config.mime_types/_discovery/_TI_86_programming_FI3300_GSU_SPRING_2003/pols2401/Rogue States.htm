<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The concept of "rogue state" plays a pre-eminent role today in policy 
  planning and analysis. The current Iraq crisis is only the latest example. 
  Washington and London declared Iraq a "rogue state," a threat to its neighbors 
  and to the entire world, an "outlaw nation" led by a reincarnation of Hitler 
  who must be contained by the guardians of world order, the United States and 
  its British "junior partner," to adopt the term ruefully employed by the 
  British foreign office half a century ago. The concept merits a close look. 
  But first, let’s consider its application in the current crisis.</P>
  <P>The most interesting feature of the debate over the Iraq crisis is that it 
  never took place. True, many words flowed, and there was dispute about how to 
  proceed. But discussion kept within rigid bounds that excluded the obvious 
  answer: the U.S. and UK should act in accord with their laws and treaty 
  obligations.</P>
  <P>The relevant legal framework is formulated in the Charter of the United 
  Nations, a "solemn treaty" recognized as the foundation of international law 
  and world order, and under the U.S. Constitution, "the supreme law of the 
  land." </P>
  <P>The Charter states that "The Security Council shall determine the existence 
  of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression, and 
  shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in 
  accordance with Articles 41 and 42," which detail the preferred "measures not 
  involving the use of armed force" and permit the Security Council to take 
  further action if it finds such measures inadequate. The only exception is 
  Article 51, which permits the "right of individual or collective self-defense" 
  against "armed attack...until the Security Council has taken the measures 
  necessary to maintain international peace and security." Apart from these 
  exceptions, member states "shall refrain in their international relations from 
  the threat or use of force." </P>
  <P>There are legitimate ways to react to the many threats to world peace. If 
  Iraq’s neighbors feel threatened, they can approach the Security Council to 
  authorize appropriate measures to respond to the threat. If the U.S. and 
  Britain feel threatened, they can do the same. But no state has the authority 
  to make its own determinations on these matters and to act as it chooses; the 
  U.S. and UK would have no such authority even if their own hands were clean, 
  hardly the case.</P>
  <P>Outlaw states do not accept these conditions: Saddam’s Iraq, for example, 
  or the United States. Its position was forthrightly articulated by Secretary 
  of State Madeleine Albright, then UN Ambassador, when she informed the 
  Security Council during an earlier U.S. confrontation with Iraq that the U.S. 
  will act "multilaterally when we can and unilaterally as we must," because "We 
  recognize this area as vital to U.S. national interests" and therefore accept 
  no external constraints. Albright reiterated that stand when UN 
  Secretary-General Kofi Annan undertook his February 1998 diplomatic mission: 
  "We wish him well," she stated, "and when he comes back we will see what he 
  has brought and how it fits with our national interest," which will determine 
  how we respond. When Annan announced that an agreement had been reached, 
  Albright repeated the doctrine: "It is possible that he will come with 
  something we don’t like, in which case we will pursue our national interest." 
  President Clinton announced that if Iraq fails the test of conformity (as 
  determined by Washington), "everyone would understand that then the United 
  States and hopefully all of our allies would have the unilateral right to 
  respond at a time, place and manner of our own choosing," in the manner of 
  other violent and lawless states.</P>
  <P>The Security Council unanimously endorsed Annan’s agreement, rejecting 
  U.S./UK demands that it authorize their use of force in the event of 
  non-compliance. The resolution warned of "severest consequences," but with no 
  further specification. In the crucial final paragraph, the Council "decides, 
  in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter, to remain actively 
  seized of the matter, in order to ensure implementation of this resolution and 
  to ensure peace and security in the area." The Council, no one else; in 
  accordance with the Charter.</P>
  <P>The facts were clear and unambiguous. Headlines read: "An Automatic Strike 
  Isn’t Endorsed" (<I>Wall St. Journal</I>); "U.N. Rebuffs U.S. on threat to 
  Iraq if it Breaks Pact" (<I>New York Times)</I>; etc. Britain’s UN Ambassador 
  "privately assured his colleagues on the council that the resolution does not 
  grant the United States and Britain an ‘automatic trigger’ to launch strikes 
  against Iraq if it impedes" UN searches. "It has to be the Security Council 
  who determines when to use armed force," the Ambassador of Costa Rica 
  declared, expressing the position of the Security Council.</P>
  <P>Washington’s reaction was different. U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson 
  asserted that the agreement "did not preclude the unilateral use of force" and 
  that the U.S. retains its legal right to attack Baghdad at will. State 
  Department spokesperson James Rubin dismissed the wording of the resolution as 
  "not as relevant as the kind of private discussions that we’ve had": "I am not 
  saying that we don’t care about that resolution," but "we’ve made clear that 
  we don’t see the need to return to the Security Council if there is a 
  violation of the agreement." The President stated that the resolution 
  "provides authority to act" if the U.S. is dissatisfied with Iraqi compliance; 
  his press secretary made clear that that means military action. "U.S Insists 
  It Retains Right to Punish Iraq," the <I>New York Times </I>headline read, 
  accurately. The U.S. has the unilateral right to use force at will: 
Period.</P>
  <P>Some felt that even this stand strayed too close to our solemn obligations 
  under international and domestic law. Senate majority leader Trent Lott 
  denounced the Administration for having "subcontracted" its foreign policy "to 
  others"—to the UN Security Council. Senator John McCain warned that "the 
  United States may be subordinating its power to the United Nations," an 
  obligation only for law-abiding states. Senator John Kerry added that it would 
  be "legitimate" for the U.S. to invade Iraq outright if Saddam "remains 
  obdurate and in violation of the United Nations resolutions, and in a position 
  of threat to the world community," whether the Security Council so determines 
  or not. Such unilateral U.S. action would be "within the framework of 
  international law," as Kerry conceives it. A liberal dove who reached national 
  prominence as an opponent of the Vietnam War, Kerry explained that his current 
  stand was consistent with his earlier views. Vietnam taught him that the force 
  should be used only if the objective is "achievable and it meets the needs of 
  your country." Saddam’s invasion of Kuwait was therefore wrong for only one 
  reason: it was not "achievable," as matters turned out.</P>
  <P>At the liberal-dovish end of the spectrum, Annan’s agreement was welcomed, 
  but within the narrow framework that barred the central issues. In a typical 
  reaction, the <I>Boston Globe </I>stated that had Saddam not backed down, "the 
  United States would not only have been justified in attacking Iraq—it would 
  have been irresponsible not to," with no further questions asked. The editors 
  also called for "a universal consensus of opproprium" against "weapons of mass 
  destruction" as "the best chance the world has of keeping perverted science 
  from inflicting hitherto unimagined harm." A sensible proposal; one can think 
  of easy ways to start, without the threat of force, but these are not what are 
  intended.</P>
  <P>Political analyst William Pfaff deplored Washington’s unwillingness to 
  consult "theological or philosophical opinion," the views of Thomas Aquinas 
  and Renaissance theologian Francisco Suarez—as "a part of the analytical 
  community" in the U.S. and UK had done "during the 1950s and 1960s," seeking 
  guidance from "philosophy and theology"! But not the foundations of 
  contemporary international and domestic law, which are explicit, though 
  irrelevant to the intellectual culture. Another liberal analyst urged the U.S. 
  to face the fact that if its incomparable power "is really being exercised for 
  mankind’s sake, mankind demands some say in its use," which would not be 
  permitted by "the Constitution, the Congress nor television’s Sunday pundits"; 
  "And the other nations of the world have not assigned Washington the right to 
  decide when, where and how their interests should be served" (Ronald 
  Steel).</P>
  <P>The Constitution does happen to provide such mechanisms, namely, by 
  declaring valid treaties "the supreme law of the land," particularly the most 
  fundamental of them, the UN Charter. It further authorizes Congress to "define 
  and punish...offenses against the law of nations," undergirded by the Charter 
  in the contemporary era. It is, furthermore, a bit of an understatement to say 
  that other nations "have not assigned Washington the right"; they have 
  forcefully denied it that right, following the (at least rhetorical) lead of 
  Washington, which largely crafted the Charter.</P>
  <P>Reference to Iraq’s violation of UN resolutions was regularly taken to 
  imply that the two warrior states have the right to use force unilaterally, 
  taking the role of "world policemen"—an insult to the police, who in principle 
  are supposed to enforce the law, not tear it to shreds. There was criticism of 
  Washington’s "arrogance of power," and the like, not quite the proper terms 
  for a self-designated violent outlaw state.</P>
  <P>One might contrive a tortured legal argument to support U.S./UK claims, 
  though no one really tried. Step one would be that Iraq has violated UN 
  Resolution 687 of 3 April 1991, which declares a cease-fire "upon official 
  notification by Iraq" that it accepts the provisions that are spelled out 
  (destruction of weapons, inspection, etc.). This is probably the longest and 
  most detailed Security Council on record, but it mentions no enforcement 
  mechanism. Step two of the argument, then, would be that Iraq’s non-compliance 
  "reinvokes" Resolution 678 (29 Nov. 1990). That Resolution authorizes member 
  states "to use all necessary means to uphold and implement Resolution 660" (2 
  August 1990), which calls on Iraq to withdraw at once from Kuwait and for Iraq 
  and Kuwait "to begin immediately intensive negotations for the resolution of 
  their differences," recommending the framework of the Arab League. Resolution 
  678 also invokes "all subsequent relevant resolutions" (listing them: 662, 
  664); these are "relevant" in that they refer to the occupation of Kuwait and 
  Iraqi actions relating to it. Reinvoking 678 thus leaves matters as they were: 
  with no authorization to use force to implement the later Resolution 687, 
  which brings up completely different issues, authorizing nothing beyond 
  sanctions.</P>
  <P>There is no need to debate the matter. The U.S. and UK could readily have 
  settled all doubts by calling on the Security Council to authorize their 
  "threat and use of force," as required by the Charter. Britain did take some 
  steps in that direction, but abandoned them when it became obvious, at once, 
  that the Security Council would not go along. But these considerations have 
  little relevance in a world dominated by rogue states that reject the rule of 
  law.</P>
  <P>Suppose that the Security Council were to authorize the use of force to 
  punish Iraq for violating the cease-fire UN Resolution 687. That authorization 
  would apply to all states: for example, to Iran, which would therefore by 
  entitled to invade southern Iraq to sponsor a rebellion. Iraq is a neighbor 
  and the victim of U.S.-backed Iraqi aggression and chemical warfare, and could 
  claim, not implausibly, that its invasion would have some local support; the 
  U.S. and UK can make no such claim. Such Iranian actions, if imaginable, would 
  never be tolerated, but would be far less outrageous than the plans of the 
  self-appointed enforcers. It is hard to imagine such elementary observations 
  entering public discussion in the U.S. and UK.</P>
  <P>Contempt for the rule of law is deeply rooted in U.S. practice and 
  intellectual culture. Recall, for example, the reaction to the judgment of the 
  World Court in 1986 condemning the U.S. for "unlawful use of force" against 
  Nicaragua, demanding that it desist and pay extensive reparations, and 
  declaring all U.S. aid to the contras, whatever its character, to be "military 
  aid," not "humanitarian aid." The Court was denounced on all sides for having 
  discredited itself. The terms of the judgment were not considered fit to 
  print, and were ignored. The Democrat-controlled Congress immediately 
  authorized new funds to step up the unlawful use of force. Washington vetoed a 
  Security Council resolution calling on all states to respect international 
  law—not mentioning anyone, though the intent was clear. When the General 
  Assembly passed a similar resolution, the U.S. voted against it, effectively 
  vetoing it, joined only by Israel and El Salvador; the following year, only 
  the automatic Israeli vote could be garnered. Little of this received mention 
  in the media or journals of opinion, let alone what it signifies.</P>
  <P>Secretary of State George Shultz meanwhile explained (April 14, 1986) that 
  "Negotiations are a euphemism for capitulation if the shadow of power is not 
  cast across the bargaining table." He condemned those who advocate "utopian, 
  legalistic means like outside mediation, the United Nations, and the World 
  Court, while ignoring the power element of the equation"—sentiments not 
  without precedent in modern history.</P>
  <P>The open contempt for Article 51 is particularly revealing. It was 
  demonstrated with remarkable clarity immediately after the 1954 Geneva accords 
  on a peaceful settlement for Indochina, regarded as a "disaster" by 
  Washington, which moved at once to undermine them. The National Security 
  Council secretly decreed that even in the case of "local Communist subversion 
  or rebellion <I>not constituting armed attack</I>," the U.S. would consider 
  the use of military force, including an attack on China if it is "determined 
  to be the source" of the "subversion" (NSC 5429/2; my emphasis). The wording, 
  repeated verbatim annually in planning documents, was chosen so as to make 
  explicit the U.S. right to violate Article 51. The same document called for 
  remilitarizing Japan, converting Thailand into "the focal point of U.S. covert 
  and psychological operations in Southeast Asia," undertaking "covert 
  operations on a large and effective scale" throughout Indochina, and in 
  general, acting forcefully to undermine the Accords and the UN Charter. This 
  critically important document was grossly falsified by the <I>Pentagon 
  Papers</I> historians, and has largely disappeared from history.</P>
  <P>The U.S. proceeded to define "aggression" to include "political warfare, or 
  subversion" (by someone else, that is)—what Adlai Stevenson called "internal 
  aggression" while defending JFK’s escalation to a full-scale attack against 
  South Vietnam. When the U.S. bombed Libyan cities in 1986, the official 
  justification was "self defense against future attack." <I>New York Times</I> 
  legal specialist Anthony Lewis praised the Administration for relying "on a 
  legal argument that violence [in this case] is justified as an act of 
  self-defense," under this creative interpretation of Article 51 of the 
  Charter, which would have embarrassed a literate high school student. The U.S. 
  invasion of Panama was defended in the Security Council by Ambassador Thomas 
  Pickering by appeal to Article 51, which, he declared, "provides for the use 
  of armed force to defend a country, to defend our interests and our people," 
  and entitles the U.S. to invade Panama to prevent its "territory from being 
  used as a base for smuggling drugs into the United States." Educated opinion 
  nodded sagely in assent.</P>
  <P>In June 1993, Clinton ordered a missile attack on Iraq, killing civilians 
  and greatly cheering the president, congressional doves, and the press, who 
  found the attack "appropriate, reasonable and necessary." Commentators were 
  particularly impressed by Ambassador Albright’s appeal to Article 51. The 
  bombing, she explained, was in "self-defense against armed attack"—namely, an 
  alleged attempt to assassinate former president Bush two months earlier, an 
  appeal that would have scarcely risen to the level of absurdity even if the 
  U.S. had been able to demonstrate Iraqi involvement; "Administration 
  officials, speaking anonymously," informed the press "that the judgment of 
  Iraq’s guilt was based on circumstantial evidence and analysis rather than 
  ironclad intelligence," the <I>New York Times</I> reported, dismissing the 
  matter. The press assured elite opinion that the circumstances "plainly fit" 
  Article 51 (<I>Washington Post</I>). "Any President has a duty to use military 
  force to protect the nation’s interests" (<I>New York Times</I>, while 
  expressing some skepticism about the case in hand). "Diplomatically, this was 
  the proper rationale to invoke," and "Clinton’s reference to the UN charter 
  conveyed an American desire to respect international law" (<I>Boston 
  Globe</I>). Article 51 "permits states to respond militarily if they are 
  threatened by a hostile power" (<I>Christian Science Monitor</I>). Article 51 
  entitles a state to use force "in self-defence against threats to one’s 
  nationals," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd instructed Parliament, 
  supporting Clinton’s "justified and proportionate exercise of the right of 
  self-defence." There would be a "dangerous state of paralysis" in the world, 
  Hurd continued, if the U.S. were required to gain Security Council approval 
  before launching missiles against an enemy that might—or might not—have 
  ordered a failed attempt to kill an ex-President two months earlier.</P>
  <P>The record lends considerable support to the concern widely voiced about 
  "rogue states" that are dedicated to the rule of force, acting in the 
  "national interest" as defined by domestic power; most ominously, rogue states 
  that anoint themselves global judge and executioner.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><BIG><BIG>Rogue States: the Narrow Construction</BIG></BIG></P>
  <P>It is also interesting to review the issues that did enter the non-debate 
  on the Iraq crisis. But first a word about the concept "rogue state." </P>
  <P>The basic conception is that although the Cold War is over, the U.S. still 
  has the responsibility to protect the world—but from what? Plainly it cannot 
  be from the threat of "radical nationalism"—that is, unwillingness to submit 
  to the will of the powerful. Such ideas are only fit for internal planning 
  documents, not the general public. From the early 1980s, it was clear that the 
  conventional technique for mass mobilization was losing its effectiveness: the 
  appeal to JFK’s "monolithic and ruthless conspiracy," Reagan’s "evil empire." 
  New enemies were needed.</P>
  <P>At home, fear of crime—particularly drugs—was stimulated by "a variety of 
  factors that have little or nothing to do with crime itself," the National 
  Criminal Justice Commission concluded, including media practices and "the role 
  of government and private industry in stoking citizen fear," "exploiting 
  latent racial tension for political purposes," with racial bias in enforcement 
  and sentencing that is devastating black communities, creating a "racial 
  abyss" and putting "the nation at risk of a social catastrophe." The results 
  have been described by criminologists as "the American Gulag," "the new 
  American Apartheid," with African Americans now a majority of prisoners for 
  the first time in U.S. history, imprisoned at well over seven times the rate 
  of whites, completely out of the range of arrest rates, which themselves 
  target blacks far out of proportion to drug use or trafficking.</P>
  <P>Abroad, the threats were to be "international terrorism," "Hispanic 
  narcotraffickers," and most serious of all, "rogue states." A secret 1995 
  study of the Strategic Command, which is responsible for the strategic nuclear 
  arsenal, outlines the basic thinking. Released through the Freedom of 
  Information act, the study, <I>Essentials of Post-Cold War Deterrence</I>, 
  "shows how the United States shifted its deterrent strategy from the defunct 
  Soviet Union to so-called rogue states such as Iraq, Libya, Cuba and North 
  Korea," AP reports. The study advocates that the U.S. exploit its nuclear 
  arsenal to portray itself as "irrational and vindictive if its vital interests 
  are attacked." That "should be a part of the national persona we project to 
  all adversaries," particularly the "rogue states." "It hurts to portray 
  ourselves as too fully rational and cool-headed," let alone committed to such 
  silliness as international law and treaty obligations. "The fact that some 
  elements" of the U.S. government "may appear to be potentially ‘out of 
  control’ can be beneficial to creating and reinforcing fears and doubts within 
  the minds of an adversary’s decision makers." The report resurrects Nixon’s 
  "madman theory": our enemies should recognize that we are crazed and 
  unpredictable, with extraordinary destructive force at our command, so they 
  will bend to our will in fear. The concept was apparently devised in Israel in 
  the 1950s by the governing Labor Party, whose leaders "preached in favor of 
  acts of madness," Prime Minister Moshe Sharett records in his diary, warning 
  that "we will go crazy" ("nishtagea") if crossed, a "secret weapon" aimed in 
  part against the U.S., not considered sufficiently reliable at the time. In 
  the hands of the world’s sole superpower, which regards itself as an outlaw 
  state and is subject to few constraints from elites within, that stance poses 
  no small problem for the world.</P>
  <P>Libya was a favorite choice as "rogue state" from the earliest days of the 
  Reagan administration. Vulnerable and defenseless, it is a perfect punching 
  bag when needed: for example, in 1986, when the first bombing in history 
  orchestrated for prime time TV was used by the Great Communicator’s speech 
  writers to muster support for Washington’s terrorist forces attacking 
  Nicaragua, on grounds that the "archterrorist" Qaddafi "has sent $400 million 
  and an arsenal of weapons and advisors into Nicaragua to bring his war home to 
  the United States," which was then exercising its right of self-defense 
  against the armed attack of the Nicaraguan rogue state.</P>
  <P>Immediately after the Berlin Wall fell, ending any resort to the Soviet 
  threat, the Bush administration submitted its annual call to Congress for a 
  huge Pentagon budget. It explained that "In a new era, we foresee that our 
  military power will remain an essential underpinning of the global balance, 
  but...the more likely demands for the use of our military forces may not 
  involve the Soviet Union and may be in the Third World, where new capabilities 
  and approaches may be required," as "when President Reagan directed American 
  naval and air forces to return to [Libya] in 1986" to bombard civilian urban 
  targets, guided by the goal of "contributing to an international environment 
  of peace, freedom and progress within which our democracy—and other free 
  nations—can flourish." The primary threat we face is the "growing 
  technological sophistication" of the Third World. We must therefore strengthen 
  "the defense industrial base"—aka high tech industry—creating incentives "to 
  invest in new facilities and equipment as well as in research and 
  development." And we must maintain intervention forces, particularly those 
  targeting the Middle East, where the "threats to our interests" that have 
  required direct military engagement "could not be laid at the Kremlin’s door" 
  —contrary to endless fabrication, now put to rest. As had occasionally been 
  recognized in earlier years, sometimes in secret, the "threat" is now conceded 
  officially to be indigenous to the region, the "radical nationalism" that has 
  always been a primary concern, not only in the Middle East.</P>
  <P>At the time, the "threats to our interests" could not be laid at Iraq’s 
  door either. Saddam was then a favored friend and trading partner. His status 
  changed only a few months later, when he misinterpreted U.S. willingness to 
  allow him to modify the border with Kuwait by force as authorization to take 
  the country over—or from the perspective of the Bush administration, to 
  duplicate what the U.S. had just done in Panama. At a high-level meeting 
  immediately after Saddam’s invasion of Kuwait, President Bush articulated the 
  basic problem: "My worry about the Saudis is that they’re...going to bug out 
  at the last minute and accept a puppet regime in Kuwait." Chair of the Joint 
  Chiefs Colin Powell posed the problem sharply: "The next few days Iraq will 
  withdraw," putting "his puppet in" and "Everyone in the Arab world will be 
  happy." </P>
  <P>Historical parallels are never exact, of course. When Washington partially 
  withdrew from Panama after putting its puppet in, there was great anger 
  throughout the hemisphere, including Panama. Indeed throughout much of the 
  world, compelling Washington to veto two Security Council resolutions and to 
  vote against a General Assembly resolution condemning Washington’s "flagrant 
  violation of international law and of the independence, sovereignty and 
  territorial integrity of states" and calling for the withdrawal of the "US 
  armed invasion forces from Panama." Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait was treated 
  differently, in ways remote from the standard version, but readily discovered 
  in print (including this magazine).</P>
  <P>The inexpressible facts shed interesting light on the commentary of 
  political analysts: Ronald Steel, for example, who muses today on the 
  "conundrum" faced by the U.S., which, "as the world’s most powerful nation, 
  faces greater constraints on its freedom to use force than does any other 
  country." Hence Saddam’s success in Kuwait as compared with Washington’s 
  inability to exert its will in Panama.</P>
  <P>It is worth recalling that debate was effectively foreclosed in 1990-1991 
  as well. There was much discussion of whether sanctions would work, but none 
  of whether they already had worked, perhaps shortly after Resolution 660 was 
  passed. Fear that sanctions might have worked animated Washington’s refusal to 
  test Iraqi withdrawal offers from August 1990 to early January. With the 
  rarest of exceptions, the information system kept tight discipline on the 
  matter. Polls a few days before the January 1991 bombing showed 2-1 support 
  for a peaceful settlement based on Iraqi withdrawal along with an 
  international conference on the Israel-Arab conflict. Few among those who 
  expressed this position could have heard any public advocacy of it; the media 
  had loyally followed the President’s lead, dismissing "linkage" as 
  unthinkable—in this unique case. It is unlikely that any respondents knew that 
  their views were shared by the Iraqi democratic opposition, barred from 
  mainstream media. Or that an Iraqi proposal in the terms they advocated had 
  been released a week earlier by U.S. officials who found it reasonable, and 
  flatly rejected by Washington. Or that an Iraqi withdrawal offer had been 
  considered by the National Security Council as early as mid-August, but 
  dismissed, and effectively suppressed, apparently because it was feared that 
  unmentioned Iraqi initiatives might "defuse the crisis," as the <I>New York 
  Times</I> diplomatic correspondent obliquely reported Administration 
  concerns.</P>
  <P>Since then, Iraq has displaced Iran and Libya as the leading "rogue state." 
  Others have never entered the ranks. Perhaps the most relevant case is 
  Indonesia, which shifted from enemy to friend when General Suharto took power 
  in 1965, presiding over an enormous slaughter that elicited great satisfaction 
  in the West. Since then Suharto has been "our kind of guy," as the Clinton 
  administration described him, while carrying out murderous aggression and 
  endless atrocities against his own people; killing 10,000 Indonesians just in 
  the 1980s, according to the personal testimony of "our guy," who wrote that 
  "the corpses were left lying around as a form of shock therapy." In December 
  1975 the UN Security Council unanimously ordered Indonesia to withdraw its 
  invading forces from East Timor "without delay" and called upon "all States to 
  respect the territorial integrity of East Timor as well as the inalienable 
  right of its people to self-determination." The U.S. responded by (secretly) 
  increasing shipments of arms to the aggressors; Carter accelerated the arms 
  flow once again as the attack reached near-genocidal levels in 1978. In his 
  memoirs, UN Ambassador Daniel Patrick Moynihan takes pride in his success in 
  rendering the UN "utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook," 
  following the instructions of the State Department, which "wished things to 
  turn out as they did and worked to bring this about." The U.S. also happily 
  accepts the robbery of East Timor’s oil (with participation of a U.S. 
  company), in violation of any reasonable interpretation of international 
  agreements.</P>
  <P>The analogy to Iraq/Kuwait is close, though there are differences: to 
  mention only the most obvious, U.S.-sponsored atrocities in East Timor were 
  vastly beyond anything attributed to Saddam Hussein in Kuwait.</P>
  <P>There are many other examples, though some of those commonly invoked should 
  be treated with caution, particularly concerning Israel. The civilian toll of 
  Israel’s U.S.-backed invasion of Lebanon in 1982 exceeded Saddam’s in Kuwait, 
  and it remains in violation of a 1978 Security Council resolution ordering it 
  to withdraw forthwith from Lebanon, along with numerous others regarding 
  Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and other matters; and there would be far more 
  if the U.S. did not regularly veto such resolutions. But the common charge 
  that Israel, particularly its current government, is violating UN 242 and the 
  Oslo Accords, and that the U.S. exhibits a "double standard" by tolerating 
  those violations, is dubious at best, based on serious misunderstanding of 
  these agreements. From the outset, the Madrid-Oslo process was designed and 
  implemented by U.S.-Israeli power to impose a Bantustan-style settlement. The 
  Arab world has chosen to delude itself about the matter, as have many others, 
  but they are clear in the actual documents, and particularly in the 
  U.S.-supported projects of the Rabin-Peres governments, including those for 
  which the current Likud government is now being denounced.</P>
  <P>It is clearly untrue to claim that "Israel is not demonstrably in violation 
  of Security Council decrees" (<I>New York Times</I>), but the reasons often 
  given should be examined carefully.</P>
  <P>Returning to Iraq, it surely qualifies as a leading criminal state. 
  Defending the U.S. plan to attack Iraq at a televised public meeting on 
  February 18, Secretaries Albright and Cohen repeatedly invoked the ultimate 
  atrocity: Saddam was guilty of "using weapons of mass destruction against his 
  neighbors as well as his own people," his most awesome crime. "It is very 
  important for us to make clear that the United States and the civilized world 
  cannot deal with somebody who is willing to use those weapons of mass 
  destruction on his own people, not to speak of his neighbors," Albright 
  emphasized in an angry response to a questioner who asked about U.S. support 
  for Suharto. Shortly after, Senator Lott condemned Kofi Annan for seeking to 
  cultivate a "human relationship with a mass murderer," and denounced the 
  Administration for trusting a person who would sink so low. </P>
  <P>Ringing words. Putting aside their evasion of the question raised, Albright 
  and Cohen only forgot to mention—and commentators have been kind enough not to 
  point out—that the acts that they now find so horrifying did not turn Iraq 
  into a "rogue state." And Lott failed to note that his heroes Reagan and Bush 
  forged unusually warm relations with the "mass murderer." There were no 
  passionate calls for a military strike after Saddam’s gassing of Kurds at 
  Halabja in March 1988; on the contrary, the U.S. and UK extended their strong 
  support for the mass murderer, then also "our kind of guy." When ABC TV 
  correspondent Charles Glass revealed the site of one of Saddam’s biological 
  warfare programs ten months after Halabja, the State Department denied the 
  facts, and the story died; the Department "now issues briefings on the same 
  site," Glass observes.</P>
  <P>The two guardians of global order also expedited Saddam’s other 
  atrocities—including his use of cyanide, nerve gas, and other barbarous 
  weapons—with intelligence, technology, and supplies, joining with many others. 
  The Senate Banking Committee reported in 1994 that the U.S. Commerce 
  Department had traced shipments of "biological materials" identical to those 
  later found and destroyed by UN inspectors, Bill Blum recalls. These shipments 
  continued at least until November 1989. A month later, Bush authorized new 
  loans for his friend Saddam, to achieve the "goal of increasing U.S. exports 
  and put us in a better position to deal with Iraq regarding its human rights 
  record...," the State Department announced with a straight face, facing no 
  criticism in the mainstream (or even report).</P>
  <P>Britain’s record was exposed, at least in part, in an official inquiry 
  (Scott Inquiry). The British government has just now been compelled to concede 
  that it continued to grant licenses to British firms to export materials 
  usable for biological weapons after the Scott report was published, at least 
  until December 1996.</P>
  <P>In a February 28 review of Western sales of materials usable for germ 
  warfare and other weapons of mass destruction, the <I>Times</I> mentions one 
  example of U.S. sales in the 1980s, including "deadly pathogens," with 
  government approval, some from the Army’s center for germ research in Fort 
  Detrick. Just the tip of the iceberg, however.</P>
  <P>A common current pretense is Saddam’s crimes were unknown, so we are now 
  properly shocked at the discovery and must "make clear" that we civilized folk 
  "cannot deal with" the perpetrator of such crimes (Albright). The posture is 
  cynical fraud. UN Reports of 1986 and 1987 condemned Iraq’s use of chemical 
  weapons. U.S. Embassy staffers in Turkey interviewed Kurdish survivors of 
  chemical warfare attacks, and the CIA reported them to the State Department. 
  Human Rights groups reported the atrocities at Halabja and elsewhere at once. 
  Secretary of State George Shultz conceded that the U.S. had evidence on the 
  matter. An investigative team sent by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
  in 1988 found "overwhelming evidence of extensive use of chemical weapons 
  against civilians," charging that Western acquiescence in Iraqi use of such 
  weapons against Iran had emboldened Saddam to believe—correctly—that he could 
  use them against his own people with impunity—actually against Kurds, hardly 
  "the people" of this tribal-based thug. The chair of the Committee, Claiborne 
  Pell, introduced the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, denouncing silence 
  "while people are gassed" as "complicity," much as when "the world was silent 
  as Hitler began a campaign that culminated in the near extermination of 
  Europe’s Jews," and warning that "we cannot be silent to genocide again." The 
  Reagan administration strongly opposed sanctions and insisted that the matter 
  be silenced, while extending its support for the mass murderer. In the Arab 
  world, "the Kuwait press was amongst the most enthusiastic of the Arab media 
  in supporting Baghdad’s crusade against the Kurds," journalist Adel Darwish 
  reports.</P>
  <P>In January 1991, while the war drums were beating, the International 
  Commission of Jurists observed to the UN Human Rights Commission that "After 
  having perpetrated the most flagrant abuses on its own population without a 
  word of reproach from the UN, Iraq must have concluded it could do whatever it 
  pleased"; UN in this context means U.S. and UK, primarily. That truth must be 
  buried along with international law and other "utopian" distractions. </P>
  <P>An unkind commentator might remark that recent U.S./UK toleration for 
  poison gas and chemical warfare is not too surprising. The British used 
  chemical weapons in their 1919 intervention in North Russia against the 
  Bolsheviks, with great success according to the British command. As Secretary 
  of State at the War Office in 1919, Winston Churchill was enthusiastic about 
  the prospects of "using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes"—Kurds and 
  Afghans—and authorized the RAF Middle East command to use chemical weapons 
  "against recalcitrant Arabs as experiment," dismissing objections by the India 
  office as "unreasonable" and deploring the "squeamishness about the use of 
  gas": "we cannot in any circumstances acquiesce in the non-utilisation of any 
  weapons which are available to procure a speedy termination of the disorder 
  which prevails on the frontier," he explained; chemical weapons are merely 
  "the application of Western science to modern warfare." </P>
  <P>The Kennedy administration pioneered the massive use of chemical weapons 
  against civilians as it launched its attack against South Vietnam in 
  1961-1962. There has been much rightful concern about the effects on U.S. 
  soldiers, but not the incomparably worse effects on civilians. Here, at least. 
  In an Israeli mass-circulation daily, the respected journalist Amnon Kapeliouk 
  reported on his 1988 visit to Vietnam, where he found that "Thousands of 
  Vietnamese still die from the effects of American chemical warfare," citing 
  estimates of one-quarter of a million victims in South Vietnam and describing 
  the "terrifying" scenes in hospitals in the south with children dying of 
  cancer and hideous birth deformities. It was South Vietnam that was targeted 
  for chemical warfare, not the North, where these consequences are not found, 
  he reports. There is also substantial evidence of U.S. use of biological 
  weapons against Cuba, reported as minor news in 1977, and at worst only a 
  small component of continuing U.S. terror.</P>
  <P>These precedents aside, the U.S. and UK are now engaged in a deadly form of 
  biological warfare in Iraq. The destruction of infrastructure and banning of 
  imports to repair it has caused disease, malnutrition, and early death on a 
  huge scale, including 567,000 children by 1995, according to UN 
  investigations; UNICEF reports 4,500 children dying a month in 1996. In a 
  bitter condemnation of the sanctions (January 20, 1998), 54 Catholic Bishops 
  quoted the Archbishop of the southern region of Iraq, who reports that 
  "epidemics rage, taking away infants and the sick by the thousands" while 
  "those children who survive disease succumb to malnutrition." The Bishop’s 
  statement, reported in full in Stanley Heller’s journal <I>The Struggle</I>, 
  received scant mention in the press. The U.S. and Britain have taken the lead 
  in blocking aid programs—for example, delaying approval for ambulances on the 
  grounds that they could be used to transport troops, barring insecticides to 
  prevent spread of disease and spare parts for sanitation systems. Meanwhile, 
  western diplomats point out, "The U.S. had directly benefited from [the 
  humanitarian] operation as much, if not more, than the Russians and the 
  French," for example, by purchase of $600 million worth of Iraqi oil (second 
  only to Russia) and sale by U.S. companies of $200 million in humanitarian 
  goods to Iraq. They also report that most of the oil bought by Russian 
  companies ends up in the U.S.</P>
  <P>Washington’s support for Saddam reached such an extreme that it was even 
  willing to overlook an Iraqi air force attack on the <I>USS</I> <I>Stark</I>, 
  killing 37 of the crew, a privilege otherwise enjoyed only by Israel (in the 
  case of the <I>USS</I> <I>Liberty</I>). It was Washington’s decisive support 
  for Saddam, well after the crimes that now so shock the Administration and 
  Congress, that led to Iranian capitulation to "Baghdad and Washington," Dilip 
  Hiro concludes in his history of the Iran-Iraq war. The two allies had 
  "co-ordinate[d] their military operations against Teheran." The shooting down 
  of an Iranian civilian airliner by the guided-missile cruiser <I>Vincennes</I> 
  was the culmination of Washington’s "diplomatic, military and economic 
  campaign" in support of Saddam, he writes.</P>
  <P>Saddam was also called upon to perform the usual services of a client 
  state: for example, to train several hundred Libyans sent to Iraq by the U.S. 
  so they could overthrow the Qaddafi government, former Reagan White House aide 
  Howard Teicher revealed.</P>
  <P>It was not his massive crimes that elevated Saddam to the rank of "Beast of 
  Baghdad." Rather, it was his stepping out of line, much as in the case of the 
  far more minor criminal Noriega, whose major crimes were also committed while 
  he was a U.S. client.</P>
  <P>In passing, one might note that the destruction of Iran Air 655 in Iranian 
  airspace by the <I>Vincennes</I> may come back to haunt Washington. The 
  circumstances are suspicious, to say the least. In the Navy’s official 
  journal, Commander David Carlson wrote that he "wondered aloud in disbelief" 
  as he observed from his nearby vessel as the <I>Vincennes</I>—then within 
  Iranian territorial waters—shot down what was obviously a civilian airliner in 
  a commercial corridor, perhaps out of "a need to prove the viability of 
  Aegis," its high tech missile system. The commander and key officers "were 
  rewarded with medals for their conduct," Marine Corps colonel (retired) David 
  Evans observes in the same journal in an acid review of the Navy Department 
  cover-up of the affair. President Bush informed the UN that "One thing is 
  clear, and that is that the <I>Vincennes </I>acted in self-defense...in the 
  midst of a naval attack initiated by Iranian vessels...," all lies Evans 
  points out, though of no significance, given Bush’s position that "I will 
  never apologize for the United States of America—I don’t care what the facts 
  are." A retired Army colonel who attended the official hearings concluded that 
  "our Navy is too dangerous to deploy." </P>
  <P>It is difficult to avoid the thought that the destruction of Pan Am 103 
  over Lockerbie a few months later was Iranian retaliation, as stated 
  explicitly by Iranian intelligence defector Abolhassem Mesbahi, also an aide 
  to President Rafsanjani, "regarded as a credible and senior Iranian source in 
  Germany and elsewhere," the <I>Guardian</I> reports. A 1991 U.S. intelligence 
  document (National Security Agency), declassified in 1997, draws the same 
  conclusion, alleging that Akbar Mohtashemi, a former Iranian interior 
  minister, transferred $10 million "to bomb Pan Am 103 in retaliation for the 
  U.S. shoot-down of the Iranian Airbus," referring to his connections with "the 
  Al Abas and Abu Nidal terrorist groups." It is striking that despite the 
  evidence and the clear motive, this is virtually the only act of terrorism 
  <U>not</U> blamed on Iran. Rather, the U.S. and UK have charged two Libyan 
  nationals with the crime.</P>
  <P>The charges against the Libyans have been widely disputed, including a 
  detailed inquiry by Denis Phipps, former head of security at British Airways 
  who served on the government’s National Aviation Committee. The British 
  organization of families of Lockerbie victims believe that there has been "a 
  major cover-up" (spokesperson Dr. Jim Swire), and regard as more credible the 
  account given in Alan Frankovich’s documentary<I> The Maltese Cross</I>, which 
  provides evidence of the Iranian connection and a drug operation involving a 
  courier working for the U.S. DEA. The film was shown at the British House of 
  Commons and on British TV, but rejected here. The U.S. families keep strictly 
  to Washington’s version.</P>
  <P>Also intriguing is the U.S./UK refusal to permit a trial of the accused 
  Libyans. This takes the form of rejection of Libya’s offer to release the 
  accused for trial in some neutral venue: to a judge nominated by the UN 
  (December 1991), a trial at the Hague "under Scottish law," etc. These 
  proposals have been backed by the Arab League and the British relatives 
  organization but flatly rejected by the U.S./UK. In March 1992, the UN 
  Security Council passed a resolution imposing sanctions against Libya, with 
  five absentions: China, Morocco (the only Arab member), India, Zimbabwe, Cape 
  Verde. There was considerable arm-twisting: thus China was warned that it 
  would lose U.S. trade preferences if it vetoed the resolution. The U.S. press 
  has reported Libya’s offer to release the suspects for trial, dismissing it as 
  worthless and ridiculing Qaddafi’s "dramatic gesture" of calling for the 
  surrender of U.S. pilots who bombed two Libyan cities, killing 37 people, 
  including his adopted daughter. Plainly, that is as absurd as requests by Cuba 
  and Costa Rica for extradition of U.S. terrorists.</P>
  <P>It is understandable that the U.S./UK should want to ensure a trial they 
  can control, as in the case of the Noriega kidnapping. Any sensible defense 
  lawyer would bring up the Iranian connection in a neutral venue. How long the 
  charade can continue is unclear. In the midst of the current Iraq crisis, the 
  World Court rejected the U.S./UK claim that it has no jurisdiction over the 
  matter, and intends to launch a full hearing (13-2, with the U.S. and British 
  judges opposed), which may make it harder to keep the lid on.</P>
  <P>The Court ruling was welcomed by Libya and the British families. Washington 
  and the U.S. media warned that the World Court ruling might prejudice the 1992 
  UN resolution that demanded that "Libya must surrender those accused of the 
  Lockerbie bombing for trial in Scotland or the United States" (<I>New York 
  Times</I>), that Libya "extradite the suspects to the United States and 
  Britain" (AP). These claims are not accurate. The issue of transfer to 
  Scotland or the U.S. never arose, and is not mentioned in the UN Resolutions. 
  Resolution 731 (21 January 1992) "Urges the Libyan Government immediately to 
  provide a full and effective response" to requests "in connection with the 
  legal procedures" related to attacks against Pan Am 103 and a French airliner. 
  Resolution 748 (31 March 1992) "Decides that the Libyan Government must now 
  comply without any further delay" with the request of Resolution 731, and that 
  it renounce terrorism, calling for sanctions if Libya fails to do so. 
  Resolution 731 was adopted in response to a U.S./UK declaration that Libya 
  must "surrender for trial all those charged with the crime," with no further 
  specification.</P>
  <P>Press reports at the time were similarly inaccurate. Thus, reporting the 
  U.S. dismissal of the Libyan offer to turn the suspects over to a neutral 
  country, the <I>New York Times</I> highlighted the words: "Again, Libya tries 
  to avoid a U.N. order." The <I>Washington Post</I> dismissed the offer as 
  well, stating that "The Security Council contends that the suspects must be 
  tried in U.S. or British courts." Doubtless Washington prefers to have matters 
  seen in this light. A correct account was given in a 1992 opinion piece by 
  international legal authority Alfred Rubin of the Fletcher School 
  (<I>Christian Science Monitor</I>), who noted that the Security Council 
  resolution makes no mention of extradition to the U.S. and UK, and observes 
  that its wording "departs so far from what the United States, Britain, and 
  France are reported to have wanted that current public statements and press 
  accounts reporting an American diplomatic triumph and UN pressures on Libya 
  seem incomprehensible"; unfortunately, the performance is all too routine.</P>
  <P>In the <I>NY Times</I>, British specialist on UN law Marc Weiler, in an 
  op-ed, agreed with Rubin that the U.S. should follow the clear requirements of 
  international law and accept Libya’s proposal for World Court adjudication. 
  Libya’s response to the U.S./UK request was "precisely as mandated by 
  international law," Weiler wrote, condemning the U.S./UK for having "flatly 
  refused" to submit the issue to the World Court. Rubin and Weiler also ask 
  obvious further questions: Suppose that New Zealand had resisted powerful 
  French pressures to compel it to abandon its attempt to extradite the French 
  government terrorists who had bombed the <I>Rainbow Warrior </I>in Auckland 
  harbor? Or that Iran were to demand that the captain of the <I>Vincennes</I> 
  be extradited?</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><BIG><BIG>The World Court has now drawn </BIG></BIG><BR><BIG><BIG>the same 
  conclusion as Rubin and Weiler.</BIG></BIG></P>
  <P>The qualifications as "rogue state" are illuminated further by Washington’s 
  reaction to the uprisings in Iraq in March 1991, immediately after the 
  cessation of hostilities. The State Department formally reiterated its refusal 
  to have any dealings with the Iraqi democratic opposition, and as from before 
  the Gulf War, they were virtually denied access to the major U.S. media. 
  "Political meetings with them would not be appropriate for our policy at this 
  time," State Department spokesperson Richard Boucher stated. "This time" 
  happened to be March 14, 1991, while Saddam was decimating the southern 
  opposition under the eyes of General Schwartzkopf, refusing even to permit 
  rebelling military officers access to captured Iraqi arms. Had it not been for 
  unexpected public reaction, Washington probably would not have extended even 
  tepid support to rebelling Kurds, subjected to the same treatment shortly 
  after.</P>
  <P>Iraqi opposition leaders got the message. Leith Kubba, head of the 
  London-based Iraqi Democratic Reform Movement, alleged that the U.S. favors a 
  military dictatorship, insisting that "changes in the regime must come from 
  within, from people already in power." London-based banker Ahmed Chalabi, head 
  of the Iraqi National Congress, said that "the United States, covered by the 
  fig leaf of non-interference in Iraqi affairs, is waiting for Saddam to 
  butcher the insurgents in the hope that he can be overthrown later by a 
  suitable officer," an attitude rooted in the U.S. policy of "supporting 
  dictatorships to maintain stability." </P>
  <P>Administration reasoning was outlined by <I>New York Times</I> chief 
  diplomatic correspondent Thomas Friedman. While opposing a popular rebellion, 
  Washington did hope that a military coup might remove Saddam, "and then 
  Washington would have the best of all worlds: an iron-fisted Iraqi junta 
  without Saddam Hussein," a return to the days when Saddam’s "iron fist...held 
  Iraq together, much to the satisfaction of the American allies Turkey and 
  Saudi Arabia," not to speak of Washington. Two years later, in another useful 
  recognition of reality, he observed that "it has always been American policy 
  that the iron-fisted Mr. Hussein plays a useful role in holding Iraq 
  together," maintaining "stability." There is little reason to believe that 
  Washington has modified the preference for dictatorship over democracy 
  deplored by the ignored Iraqi democratic opposition, though it doubtless would 
  prefer a different "iron fist" at this point. If not, Saddam will have to 
  do.</P>
  <P>The concept "rogue state" is highly nuanced. Thus Cuba qualifies as a 
  leading "rogue state" because of its alleged involvement in international 
  terrorism, but the U.S. does not fall into the category despite its terrorist 
  attacks against Cuba for close to 40 years, apparently continuing through last 
  summer according to important investigative reporting of the <I>Miami 
  Herald</I>, which failed to reach the national press (here; it did in Europe). 
  Cuba was a "rogue state" when its military forces were in Angola, backing the 
  government against South African attacks supported by the U.S. South Africa, 
  in contrast, was not a rogue state then, nor during the Reagan years, when it 
  caused over $60 billion in damage and 1.5 million deaths in neighboring states 
  according to a UN Commission, not to speak of some events at home—and with 
  ample U.S./UK support. The same exemption applies to Indonesia and many 
  others.</P>
  <P>The criteria are fairly clear: a "rogue state" is not simply a criminal 
  state, but one that defies the orders of the powerful—who are, of course, 
  exempt.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P><BIG><BIG>More On "The Debate" </BIG></BIG></P>
  <P>That Saddam is a criminal is undoubtedly true, and one should be pleased, I 
  suppose, that the U.S. and UK, and *mainstream doctrinal institutions, have at 
  last joined those who "prematurely" condemned U.S./UK support for the mass 
  murderer. It is also true that he poses a threat to anyone within his reach. 
  On the comparison of the threat with others, there is little unanimity outside 
  the U.S. and UK, after their (ambiguous) transformation from August 1990. 
  Their 1998 plan to use force was justified in terms of Saddam’s threat to the 
  region, but there was no way to conceal the fact that the people of the region 
  objected to their salvation, so strenuously that governments were compelled to 
  join in opposition.</P>
  <P>Bahrein refused to allow U.S./British forces to use bases there. The 
  president of the United Arab Emirates described U.S. threats of military 
  action as "bad and loathsome," and declared that Iraq does not pose a threat 
  to its neighbors. Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan had already stated that 
  "We’ll not agree and we are against striking Iraq as a people and as a 
  nation," causing Washington to refrain from a request to use Saudi bases. 
  After Annan’s mission, long-serving Saudi foreign minister Prince Saud 
  al-Faisal reaffirmed that any use of Saudi air bases "has to be a UN, not a 
  U.S. issue." </P>
  <P>An editorial in Egypt’s quasi-official journal <I>Al Ahram</I> described 
  Washington’s stand as "coercive, aggressive, unwise and uncaring about the 
  lives of Iraqis, who are unnecessarily subjected to sanctions and 
  humiliation," and denounced the planned U.S. "aggression against Iraq." 
  Jordan’s Parliament condemned "any aggression against Iraq’s territory and any 
  harm that might come to the Iraqi people"; the Jordanian army was forced to 
  seal off the city of Maan after two days of pro-Iraq rioting. A political 
  science professor at Kuwait University warned that "Saddam has come to 
  represent the voice of the voiceless in the Arab world," expressing popular 
  frustration over the "New World Order" and Washington’s advocacy of Israeli 
  interests.</P>
  <P>Even in Kuwait, support for the U.S. stance was at best "tepid" and 
  "cynical over U.S. motives," the press recognized. "Voices in the streets of 
  the Arab world, from Cairo’s teeming slums to the Arabian Peninsula’s shiny 
  capitals, have been rising in anger as the American drumbeat of war against 
  Iraq grows louder," <I>Boston Globe</I> correspondent Charles Sennott 
  reported.</P>
  <P>The Iraqi democratic opposition was granted a slight exposure in the 
  mainstream, breaking the previous pattern. In a telephone interview with the 
  <I>New York Times</I>, Ahmed Chalabi reiterated the position that had been 
  reported in greater detail in London weeks earlier: "Without a political plan 
  to remove Saddam’s regime, military strikes will be counter-productive," he 
  argued, killing thousands of Iraqis, leaving Saddam perhaps even strengthened 
  along with his weapons of mass destruction and with "an excuse to throw out 
  UNSCOM [the UN inspectors]," who have in fact destroyed vastly more weapons 
  and production facilities than the 1991 bombing. U.S./UK plans would "be worse 
  than nothing." Interviews with opposition leaders from several groups found 
  "near unanimity" in opposing military action that did not lay the basis for an 
  uprising to overthrow Saddam. Speaking to a Parliamentary committee, Chalabi 
  held that it was "morally indefensible to strike Iraq without a strategy" for 
  removing Saddam.</P>
  <P>In London, the opposition also outlined an alternative program: (1) declare 
  Saddam a war criminal; (2) recognize a provisional Iraqi government formed by 
  the opposition; (3) unfreeze hundreds of millions of dollars of Iraqi assets 
  abroad; restrict Saddam’s forces by a "no-drive zone" or extend the "no-flight 
  zone" to cover the whole country. The U.S. should "help the Iraqi people 
  remove Saddam from power," Chalabi told the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
  Along with other opposition leaders, he "rejected assassination, covert U.S. 
  operations or U.S. ground troops," Reuters reported, calling instead for "a 
  popular insurgency." Similar proposals have occasionally appeared in the U.S. 
  Washington claims to have attempted support for opposition groups, but their 
  own interpretation is different. Chalabi’s view, published in England, is much 
  as it was years earlier: "everyone says Saddam is boxed in, but it is the 
  Americans and British who are boxed in by their refusal to support the idea of 
  political change." </P>
  <P>Regional opposition was regarded as a problem to be evaded, not a factor to 
  be taken into account, any more than international law. The same was true of 
  warnings by senior UN and other international relief officials in Iraq that 
  the planned bombing might have a "catastrophic" effect on people already 
  suffering miserably, and might terminate the humanitarian operations that have 
  brought at least some relief. What matters is to establish that "What We Say 
  Goes," as President Bush triumphantly proclaimed, announcing the New World 
  Order as bombs and missiles were falling in 1991.</P>
  <P>As Kofi Annan was preparing to go to Baghdad, former Iranian president 
  Rafsanjani, "still a pivotal figure in Tehran, was given an audience by the 
  ailing King Fahd in Saudi Arabia," British Middle East correspondent David 
  Gardner reported, "in contrast to the treatment experienced by Madeleine 
  Albright...on her recent trips to Riyadh seeking support from America’s main 
  Gulf ally." As Rafsanjani’s ten-day visit ended on March 2, foreign minister 
  Prince Saud described it as "one more step in the right direction towards 
  improving relations," reiterating that "the greatest destabilising element in 
  the Middle East and the cause of all other problems in the region" is Israel’s 
  policy towards the Palestinians and U.S. support for it, which might activate 
  popular forces that Saudi Arabia greatly fears, as well as undermining its 
  legitimacy as "guardian" of Islamic holy places, including the Dome of the 
  Rock in East Jerusalem, now effectively annexed by U.S./Israeli programs as 
  part of their intent to extend "greater Jerusalem" virtually to the Jordan 
  Valley, to be retained by Israel. Shortly before, the Arab states had 
  boycotted a U.S.-sponsored economic summit in Qatar that was intended to 
  advance the "New Middle East" project of Clinton and Peres. Instead, they 
  attended an Islamic conference in Teheran in December, joined even by 
Iraq.</P>
  <P>These are tendencies of considerable import, relating to the background 
  concerns that motivate U.S. policy in the region: its insistence, since World 
  War II, on controlling the world’s major energy reserves. As many have 
  observed, in the Arab world there is growing fear and resentment of the 
  long-standing Israel-Turkey alliance that was formalized in 1996, now greatly
