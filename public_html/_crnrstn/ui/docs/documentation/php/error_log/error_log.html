        HELLO HTML DOCUMENTATION!
        <div class="crnrstn_cb_20"></div>
        Born on Nov. 10th, 2005, my dog...named 'J5' (proper)...is part
        Korean Jindo, German Shepherd and Timber Wolf.
        <div class="crnrstn_cb_20"></div>
        When I worked at agency, J5 accompanied me to the office on occasion as well
        as to local parks, coffee shops, neighborhood bars and even the occasional
        house party.
