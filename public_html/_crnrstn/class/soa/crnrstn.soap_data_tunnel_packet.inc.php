#        CRNRSTN :: An open source PHP class library supporting enterprise application development that is framed within
#                   the context of mature/rigid RTM protocols.

#       OVERVIEW :: CRNRSTN :: An Open Source PHP Class Library that stands on top of a robust web services oriented
#                   architecture to both facilitate, augment, and enhance (with stability) the operations of a code base
#                   for a web application across multiple hosting environments.

#    DESCRIPTION :: CRNRSTN :: is an open source PHP class library that will facilitate and spread (via SOAP services)
#                   operations of a web application across multiple servers or environments (e.g. localhost, stage,
#                   preprod, and production). With this tool, data and functionality possessing characteristics that
#                   inherently create distinctions between one environment and another can all be managed through one
#                   framework for an entire application. IP address restrictions, error logging profiles, and database
#                   authentication credentials are a few areas within an application's architecture where
#                   CRNRSTN :: was designed to excel.
#
#                   Once CRNRSTN :: has been configured to support all of a web application's running servers, one can
#                   seamlessly RTM the codebase of the web site without having to modify the configuration to account
#                   for any unique and environmentally specific parameters. Receive the benefit of a robust and polished
#                   framework that will bubble up logs from exception notifications to any output channel (email, hidden
#                   HTML comment, native default,...etc.) of one's own choosing.
#
#                   For example, stand on top of the CRNRSTN :: SOAP services layer to organize and strengthen the
#                   communications architecture of any web application. By supporting many-to-one proxy messaging
#                   relationships between slaves and a master "communications server", CRNRSTN :: can streamline and
#                   simplify the management of web application communications; one can configure everything from SMTP
#                   credentials to the character count for line wrapping in the text versions of multi-part HTML email.
#
#                   This is the "King's Highway" for sending email communications.
