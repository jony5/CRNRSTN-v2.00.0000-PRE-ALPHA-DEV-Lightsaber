				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CyeXX, Inc. regards information it recives from its clients very seriously. Information collected online can be defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable.				
				<BR><BR>	
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anonymous Information&quot; refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth.
				<BR><BR>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Personally Identifiable Information&quot; or &quot;PII&quot; refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, phone number, or postal address. Certain types of PII will be required to render services and collect payment for services. The type of information may include: 
				<UL>
					<LI>Credit card information to process your request for products, programs, or services.<BR>
					<LI>Information you provide CyeXX, Inc. when filling out a user survey. <BR>
					<LI>Information you provide if you contact customer service. <BR>
					<LI>Data related to the areas of our website that you visit and how often you visit those areas. This is purely statistical data. <BR>
				</UL>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the services dependent upon the collection of this information, such as hosting service. <BR> When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Netscape Navigator(r) or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to CyeXX, Inc. every time you access content on one of our sites. Examples of such information include the URL of the Web page you were just on (known as the &quot;Refer&quot;), the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version you are using to access our site. All of this information may be collected by CyeXX, Inc., but is purely statistical or anti-fraud in purpose.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CyeXX, Inc. takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.
