<span style="font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:17px;">Welcome</span><br /><br /><br />
If you have an existing project by <span style="color:#CC0000;">5</span> and would like support, please <a href="mailto:support@evifwebdev.com" target="_blank">contact me</a>.<br /><br />

I value every business and personal relationship and most importantly, I stand by the quality of my work.
<br /><br />As the Lead Developer &amp; Owner/Operator of <span style="color:#CC0000;">5</span>, I want to ensure that my customers continue to receive the best service and support that is possible.  I was contracted for a few months by an Atlanta-based interactive marketing company, <a href="http://www.moxieinteractive.com" target="_blank">Moxie Interactive</a>. In May 2006, I officially signed on as UI - Web Developer, am employed as such to this day.
