If you have an existing project by 5, and would like support, please <a href="mailto:support@evifwebdev.com.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>. We're working on the implementation of
 a trouble ticketing system that will allow you to monitor the status of your development or support issue 24-7.<br /><br />
 
We value every business and personal relationship and most importantly...we stand by the quality of our work.
<br /><br />On a more personal note,... please sit tight while I re-vamp my business model to support the new and exciting changes that have recently come about.  As the Lead Developer &amp; Owner/Operator of 5, I want to ensure that my customers continue to receive the best service and support that is possible.  I was contracted for a few months by an Atlanta-based interactive marketing company, <a href="http://www.moxieinteractive.com" target="_blank">Moxie Interactive</a>. In May 2006, I officially signed on as UI - Web Developer, and I am employed as such to this day.
