<h2>Overview: Obtaining an IDB</h2>

<p>Under each of the foregoing structures (listed under the link for "Obtaining an IDB"), the company will be the ultimate owner of the project and, while the bonds are outstanding, will be treated as the owner of the project for federal tax purposes and for accounting purposes. Hence, the company will be entitled to claim depreciation on the project and will be entitled to deduct interest on the bonds as a business interest expense.</p>

<p>The Company would not be entitled to deduct rent if the financing lease structure is used.  In the case of federally tax-exempt IDBs for airports, docks, wharves, and mass commuting facilities, the company will be a true lessee and will not be the tax-owner of the financed facilities and may not claim depreciation thereon, but may claim a deduction for rent.</p>

<p>The company will generally be the only obligor on the financing, except to the extent that the credit support is provided by a stockholder guaranty or letter of credit.  The issuer acts merely as a conduit.  Except in extremely rare instances, the Issuer and the related local or state government have absolutely no obligation for the repayment of the IDBs other than from funds received from the company.</p>
