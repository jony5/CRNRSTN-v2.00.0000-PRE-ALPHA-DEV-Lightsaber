<h2>About Bonds</h2>

<p>The Authority is a conduit issuer of revenue bonds for financing eligible projects for private corporate, partnership or nonprofit borrowers under the Georgia Development Authorities Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-62-6) and the Georgia Revenue Bond Law (O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62).  As a conduit issuer, the Authority does not provide funds or invest in bond financed projects, and is financially responsible for bonds only to the extent of revenues and assets pledged to the Authority for payment of such bonds.</p>

<p>The Bonds issued by the Authority may be either tax-exempt or taxable.  Tax-exempt bonds, the interest on which are exempt from federal income taxation, pursuant to certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, generally represent the least expensive form of commercial borrowing.  On the other hand, taxable bonds do not enjoy the interest exemption from federal taxation, but may often be combined with other economic development incentives, such as ad valorem tax relief.</p>
