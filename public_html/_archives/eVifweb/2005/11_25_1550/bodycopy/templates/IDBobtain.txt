<h2>Obtaining an IDB</h2>

<p>In Georgia, IDBs are usually issued by local development authorities and sometimes are issued by other state and local authorities.  The bond proceeds are passed on to the company through a financing lease, an installment sale agreement, or loan agreement, and the payments by the company thereunder match the debt service on the IDBs.</p>

<p>In Georgia, a financing lease is often used in order to obtain an exemption from local property tax by having the authority be the “owner” and lessor on the project during the term of the lease.  Such abatement actually requires more in the way of an underlying structure, but except in certain rare cases, the use of IDBs is a prerequisite.  With a financing lease, upon retirement of the bonds and the expiration of the lease, the company will acquire title to the project by purchasing the project far a nominal consideration under a purchase option in the lease.</p>
