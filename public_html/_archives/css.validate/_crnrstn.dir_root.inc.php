#  DESCRIPTION :: CRNRSTN :: An Open Source PHP Class Library providing a robust services interface layer to both
#       facilitate, augment, and enhance the operations of code base for an application across multiple hosting
#       environments. Copyright (C) 2012-2021 eVifweb development.
#  OVERVIEW :: CRNRSTN :: is an open source PHP class library that facilitates the operation of an application within
#       multiple server environments (e.g. localhost, stage, preprod, and production). With this tool, data and
#       functionality with characteristics that inherently create distinctions from one environment to the next...such
#       as IP address restrictions, error logging profiles, and database authentication credentials...can all be
#       managed through one framework for an entire application. Once CRNRSTN :: has been configured for your different
#       hosting environments, seamlessly release a web application from one environment to the next without having to
#       change your code-base to account for environmentally specific parameters. Receive the benefit of a robust and
#       polished framework for bubbling up exception notifications through any output of your choosing. Take advantage
#       of the CRNRSTN :: SOAP Services layer supporting many to 1 proxy messaging relationships between slave and
#       master servers; regarding server communications i.e. notifications, some architectures will depend on one
#       master to support the communications needs of many slaves with respect their roles and responsibilities in
#       regards to sending an email. With CRNRSTN ::, slaves configured to log exceptions via EMAIL_PROXY will send
#       all of their internal system notifications to one master server (proxy) which server would posses the (if
#       necessary) SMTP credentials for authorization to access and execute more restricted communications
#       protocols of the network.
