#  CRNRSTN ::
#  VERSION :: 2.00.0000 PRE-ALPHA-DEV
#  DATE (v1.0.0) :: July 4, 2018 - Happy Independence Day from my dog and I to you...wherever and whenever you are.
#  AUTHOR :: Jonathan 'J5' Harris, Lead Full Stack Developer
#  URI :: http://crnrstn.evifweb.com/
#  DESCRIPTION :: CRNRSTN :: An Open Source PHP Class Library providing a robust services interface layer to both
#       facilitate, augment, and enhance the operations of code base for an application across multiple hosting
#       environments. Copyright (C) 2012-2021 eVifweb development.
#  OVERVIEW :: CRNRSTN :: is an open source PHP class library that facilitates the operation of an application within
#       multiple server environments (e.g. localhost, stage, preprod, and production). With this tool, data and
#       functionality with characteristics that inherently create distinctions from one environment to the next...such
#       as IP address restrictions, error logging profiles, and database authentication credentials...can all be
#       managed through one framework for an entire application. Once CRNRSTN :: has been configured for your different
#       hosting environments, seamlessly release a web application from one environment to the next without having to
#       change your code-base to account for environmentally specific parameters. Receive the benefit of a robust and
#       polished framework for bubbling up exception notifications through any output of your choosing. Take advantage
#       of the CRNRSTN :: SOAP Services layer supporting many to 1 proxy messaging relationships between slave and
#       master servers; regarding server communications i.e. notifications, some architectures will depend on one
#       master to support the communications needs of many slaves with respect their roles and responsibilities in
#       regards to sending an email. With CRNRSTN ::, slaves configured to log exceptions via EMAIL_PROXY will send
#       all of their internal system notifications to one master server (proxy) which server would posses the (if
#       necessary) SMTP credentials for authorization to access and execute more restricted communications
#       protocols of the network.

        default_socket_timeout int
        Default timeout (in seconds) for socket based streams. Specifying a negative value means an infinite timeout.

        file_uploads bool
        Whether or not to allow HTTP file uploads. See also the upload_max_filesize, upload_tmp_dir, and post_max_size directives.

        max_execution_time int
        This sets the maximum time in seconds a script is allowed to run before it is terminated by the parser. This helps prevent poorly written scripts from tying up the server. The default setting is 30. When running PHP from the command line the default setting is 0.
        On non Windows systems, the maximum execution time is not affected by system calls, stream operations etc. Please see the set_time_limit() function for more details.
        Your web server can have other timeout configurations that may also interrupt PHP execution. Apache has a Timeout directive and IIS has a CGI timeout function. Both default to 300 seconds. See your web server documentation for specific details.

        max_input_time int
        This sets the maximum time in seconds a script is allowed to parse input data, like POST and GET. Timing begins at the moment PHP is invoked at the server and ends when execution begins. The default setting is -1, which means that max_execution_time is used instead. Set to 0 to allow unlimited time.

        memory_limit int
        This sets the maximum amount of memory in bytes that a script is allowed to allocate. This helps prevent poorly written scripts for eating up all available memory on a server. Note that to have no memory limit, set this directive to -1.
        When an int is used, the value is measured in bytes. Shorthand notation, as described in this FAQ, may also be used.

        post_max_size int
        Sets max size of post data allowed. This setting also affects file upload. To upload large files, this value must be larger than upload_max_filesize. Generally speaking, memory_limit should be larger than post_max_size. When an int is used, the value is measured in bytes. Shorthand notation, as described in this FAQ, may also be used. If the size of post data is greater than post_max_size, the $_POST and $_FILES superglobals are empty. This can be tracked in various ways, e.g. by passing the $_GET variable to the script processing the data, i.e. <form action="edit.php?processed=1">, and then checking if $_GET['processed'] is set.
        Note: PHP allows shortcuts for byte values, including K (kilo), M (mega) and G (giga). PHP will do the conversions automatically if you use any of these. Be careful not to exceed the 32 bit signed integer limit (if you're using 32bit versions) as it will cause your script to fail.

        precision int
        The number of significant digits displayed in floating point numbers. -1 means that an enhanced algorithm for rounding such numbers will be used.

        realpath_cache_size int
        Determines the size of the realpath cache to be used by PHP. This value should be increased on systems where PHP opens many files, to reflect the quantity of the file operations performed.
        The size represents the total number of bytes in the path strings stored, plus the size of the data associated with the cache entry. This means that in order to store longer paths in the cache, the cache size must be larger. This value does not directly control the number of distinct paths that can be cached.
        The size required for the cache entry data is system dependent.

        realpath_cache_ttl int
        Duration of time (in seconds) for which to cache realpath information for a given file or directory. For systems with rarely changing files, consider increasing the value.

        upload_max_filesize int
        The maximum size of an uploaded file.
        When an int is used, the value is measured in bytes. Shorthand notation, as described in this FAQ, may also be used.

        max_file_uploads int
        The maximum number of files allowed to be uploaded simultaneously. Starting with PHP 5.3.4, upload fields left blank on submission do not count towards this limit.

        variables_order string
        Sets the order of the EGPCS (Environment, Get, Post, Cookie, and Server) variable parsing. For example, if variables_order is set to "SP" then PHP will create the superglobals $_SERVER and $_POST, but not create $_ENV, $_GET, and $_COOKIE. Setting to "" means no superglobals will be set.
        Warning :: In both the CGI and FastCGI SAPIs, $_SERVER is also populated by values from the environment; S is always equivalent to ES regardless of the placement of E elsewhere in this directive.
        Note: The content and order of $_REQUEST is also affected by this directive.
