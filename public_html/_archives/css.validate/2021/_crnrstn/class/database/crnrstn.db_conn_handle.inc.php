#  CRNRSTN ::
#  VERSION :: 2.00.0000 PRE-ALPHA-DEV
#  DATE (v1.0.0) :: July 4, 2018 - Happy Independence Day from my dog and I to you...wherever and whenever you are.
#  AUTHOR :: Jonathan 'J5' Harris, Lead Full Stack Developer
#  URI :: http://crnrstn.evifweb.com/
#  DESCRIPTION :: CRNRSTN :: An Open Source PHP Class Library providing a robust services interface layer to both
#       facilitate, augment, and enhance the operations of code base for an application across multiple hosting
#       environments. Copyright (C) 2012-2021 eVifweb development.
#  OVERVIEW :: CRNRSTN :: is an open source PHP class library that facilitates the operation of an application within
#       multiple server environments (e.g. localhost, stage, preprod, and production). With this tool, data and
#       functionality with characteristics that inherently create distinctions from one environment to the next...such
#       as IP address restrictions, error logging profiles, and database authentication credentials...can all be
#       managed through one framework for an entire application. Once CRNRSTN :: has been configured for your different
#       hosting environments, seamlessly release a web application from one environment to the next without having to
#       change your code-base to account for environmentally specific parameters. Receive the benefit of a robust and
#       polished framework for bubbling up exception notifications through any output of your choosing. Take advantage
#       of the CRNRSTN :: SOAP Services layer supporting many to 1 proxy messaging relationships between slave and
#       master servers; regarding server communications i.e. notifications, some architectures will depend on one
#       master to support the communications needs of many slaves with respect their roles and responsibilities in
#       regards to sending an email. With CRNRSTN ::, slaves configured to log exceptions via EMAIL_PROXY will send
#       all of their internal system notifications to one master server (proxy) which server would posses the (if
#       necessary) SMTP credentials for authorization to access and execute more restricted communications
#       protocols of the network.

        mysqli_stat() returns a string containing information similar to that provided by the 'mysqladmin status' command. This includes uptime in seconds and the number of running threads, questions, reloads, and open tables.
        Here is an explanation of the values that appear in connection->stat() returned string. It was taken from Ai Hua's April 29, 2006 answer on http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?12,86570,86570.

        Uptime--The number of seconds the MySQL server has been running.

        Threads--The number of active threads (clients).

        Questions--The number of questions (queries) from clients since the server was started.

        Slow queries--The number of queries that have taken more than long_query_time seconds.

        Opens--The number of tables the server has opened.

        Flush tables--The number of flush-*, refresh, and reload commands the server has executed.

        Open tables--The number of tables that currently are open.

        Queries per second avg--Questions divided by Uptime


        mysqli_get_connection_stats($link)
        Don't forget that "mysqlnd.collect_statistics" must be set to "1" in your ini config to use this method.
        print_r(mysqli_get_connection_stats($link));
        ...or...
        $result = $mysqli->query('SHOW SESSION STATUS;', MYSQLI_USE_RESULT);
        while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
            $array[$row['Variable_name']] = $row['Value'];
        }
        $result->close();
