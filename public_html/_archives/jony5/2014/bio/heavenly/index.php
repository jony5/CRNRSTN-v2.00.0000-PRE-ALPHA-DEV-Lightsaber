                                <div class="copy_sub_title">Born into sin; freed through Christ to serve</div>
								While the Bible tells me that I am a sinner...born into this world wholly in sin...and destined to die according to God's righteousness because of the 
                                sin that dwells in me, I equally believe the good news also spoken by God through His Word that He sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin 
                                to die in my place. Thus the Lord Jesus...having taken my place on the tree...has henceforth satisfied God's righteous requirement under the law; through 
                                faith (not works), <strong>I am freed in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. Amen!</strong>
                                
                                <br /><br />It was this law of sin and of death that was preventing me from coming forward to God. Now that sin and death have been abolished in Jesus Christ, 
                                I have access to God through my spirit. It is my very faith in the power and effectiveness of the Lord's death that has freed me; there is nothing I can physically 
                                do (apart from this faith) to gain redemption through Christ to God.
                                
                                <br /><br />The way is through faith. The Christian life is a life lived through faith in Christ and unto God.
                                
                                <br /><br /><div class="copy_sub_title">Saved through faith in Christ; not saved by works</div>
                                An unbeliever need do absolutely nothing except 1) believe that they are a sinner destined to die based on the righteous requirement of God's law and 2) 
                                having a little faith (faith even as small as a mustard seed) that Jesus Christ has fulfilled this requirement by dying an all inclusive death (once for all), and 
                                instantly God will apply His Son's death to that individual's account; God will infuse Himself as life through His Spirit into their human spirit (regeneration). 
                                This is what it means to be born anew, born again or to receive Salvation, and this is a divine fact. Salvation is a person...the very Jesus Himself. Whoever calls 
                                upon the name of the Lord shall be saved! 
                                
                                <br /><br />Then through baptism, that brother or sister would be making a declaration to the entire universe that they are dead to the world (being buried under the water)...and henceforth and forevermore are alive to Christ (being raised up out of the death waters)! Amen!

                                <div class="copy_sub_title">The Christian dress code is...don't ask me; YOU ask the Lord about tying on those shoes</div>
                                It may be necessary for man to create dress codes and codes of conduct so that persons may occupy and execute the responsibilities of specific offices properly. 
                                
                                <br /><br />But before God (and according to the New Testament ministry of the apostles)...it is not so with His children. For example, a child of God wearing a crew-cut hair style 
                                would be just as likely to receive an instant Word from the Lord as if they were wearing a mo-hawk, pig-tails, pony-tail, mullet, bald(ing) or dread-locks...so long as 
                                they were walking in oneness with the Lord. <strong>Each believer should look to the Lord for His leading on what to wear, where to go, what and when to eat...trusting that the 
                                Lord will cover their decision under His precious blood.</strong>
                                
                                <br /><br />The Lord will let them know if He is not comfortable...as they themselves won't be comfortable. And that 
                                interaction needs to happen between each individual believer and the Lord Himself. I have no business trying to mediate for that brother or sister to their face. 
                                <strong>Why should I rob them of that faith & relationship building experience with the Lord?</strong> And likewise, I also must take all matters to the Lord in private. May the Lord 
                                gain what He is after in each of us.
                                
                                <br /><br />God has no dress code, no behavior code and no relationships-with-people code that one can apply systematically to improve their chances (or their kids chances) 
                                at gaining salvation through Christ and growing in life unto maturity. Religion has dress codes, religion has behavior codes and religion defines for us the social pariahs. 
                                These man made laws promise to help the Children of God attain to some higher level of holiness or Christian expression, but in reality they end up preventing Believers from 
                                cultivating a meaningful relationship with the dear Lord Jesus...<strong>and this stunts their growth and maturity in the divine life.</strong>
                                
                                <br /><br />Such a relationship should be personal, intimate and fresh all the time. The Lord wants to be active in every decision that His children make at every moment of 
                                every day. Isn't this awesome!?!
