                        	<p><strong>Gen. 25:23</strong> - And Jehovah said to her, / Two nations are in your womb, / And two peoples shall be separated from your bowels. / And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. / And the older shall serve the younger.</p>

<p><strong>Gen. 25:24-26</strong> - And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 25 And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 26 And after that his brother came forth, and his hand was holding on to Esau's heel, so his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p>
 
<p><strong>Gen. 36:12a</strong> - And Timna was a concubine to Eliphaz, Esau's son, and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz.</p>

<p><strong>Exo. 17:8-16</strong> - 8 Then Amalek came and fought with Isreal in Rephidim. 9 And Moses said to Joshua, Choose men for us, and go out; fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand. 10 So Joshua did as Moses has said to him and fought with Amalek; and Moses Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. 11 And when Moses lifted his hand up, Israel prevailed; and when he let his hand down, Amalek prevailed. 12 But Moses' hands were heavy, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other side. So his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 13 And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 14 And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this as a memorial in a book and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. 15 And Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi; 16 For he said, For there is a hand against the throne of Jah! Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. </p>

<p><strong>Mal. 1:2-3</strong> - I have loved you, says Jehovah; but you say, How have You loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother, declares Jehovah? Yet I loved Jacob; 3 But Esau I hated, and I made his mountains a desolation, and gave his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.</p>

<p><strong>Rom 9:13</strong> - As it is written, "Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."</p>

<p><strong>Eph. 6:11-12</strong> - Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil, 12 For our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.</p>

                       <p> Before these matters are laid at your feet for your consideration (and with the hope and expectation that the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit will follow), I have to humbly acknowledge my sources: 1) the faithful ministry of brothers Watchman Nee and Witness Lee (with those serving alongside them to shepherd the churches) combined with 2) the instant revelation...the instant speaking...of the Lord Jesus Christ as the all-inclusive, compound, seven-fold intensified, life-giving Spirit who dwells within my human spirit. The combination of these two (2) exposed the spiritual identity of an entity of people responsible for a certain vein of events which have been taking place in my life since beginning around Q3 of 2011.</p>

<p>I say "spiritual identity" because the battle which God's people, the saints, are fighting at this very moment is not against blood and flesh (Eph. 6:11-12). There is a spiritual war taking place in this universe, and only a built up body of serving priests (the church)...God's saints...can be in a proper position to stand with God and gain the victory over God's enemy, Satan.</p>

<p>To see "The Amalekite Princess", one must first have an understanding and an application of fundamental principles of God's economy. One must live their life by and according to their mingled spirit...allowing their spirit to be the leading organ in their being. One must spend their days abiding in the enjoyment of the Lord Jesus Christ...giving thanks for all things in simplicity.</p>

<p>Second, the saints must have the deep conviction and realization that when their conscience condemns them, that is God operating within their being to accuse or even excuse them regarding matters of their daily life and living (1 John 3:20). <strong>The divine revelation goes even further to identify our regenerated human spirit with the very throne of God in the universe (Heb. 4:16,12).</strong> The throne of God is the very center of God's divine administration in the whole universe. Saints, our human spirit is the very gate of heaven (Gen. 28:17)...the key to our entrance into (and existence in) the reality of God's kingdom.</p>

<p>Finally, one must understand the role of Amalek in God's economy. The divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures is very clear and consistent regarding the descendants of Esau...the Amalekites. Spiritually speaking, "Amalek typifies the flesh which is the totality of the fallen old man (Gal. 2:16). The fighting between Amalek and Israel depicts the conflict between the flesh and the Spirit within the believers." "The flesh is God's enemy. It has neither the intention nor the ability to obey God (Rom. 8:7-8)".</p>

<p>The role of Amalek can be summarized by Moses' experience of building and naming an alter after the defeat of Amalek in Exo. 17. "And Moses built an altar and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi; For he said, For there is a hand against the throne of Jah!" The flesh...Amalek..."is a hand against" or a "raised...fist against the Lord's throne".</p>

<p>Now, why would I identify some group of people in my life as being the spiritual embodiment of an "Amalekite Princess"? The Lord revealed to me that certain oppressive situations which were being orchestrated around me were being done with the intention or expectation of "tricking my conscience" into telling me that I had done something wrong (when only appearances of wrong doing were being created). Why would someone try to trick my conscience?</p>

<p>Modern science has discovered that when you feel guilty, there is activity in your brain which gives off a unique signature that can be monitored and recorded with technology. This Amalekite Princess knows when I feel guilty! And this particular data is what the Amalekite Princess was looking for when she was running her game around me. If this princess could show the whole world that a Christian's conscience was totally "trickable", it would follow that any "divine involvement in the inner being of a Christian" is just a figment of a Christian's imagination. This position would clearly give ground for Satan to attack the divine revelation in its application before the whole world.</p>

<p>If this Amalekite Princess could show that a simple "spilled sugar trick" could trigger my conscience into condemning me and making me feel guilty, she would have the ground to go further and speculate that since an all-knowing God could never be tricked like this...God must not be leading Jonathan 'J5' Harris (or perhaps anyone else on this planet!) in his human spirit as the Word of God clearly reveals and as I have been strongly testifying. <strong>The Lord revealed to me that someone was hovering around a position which was going to give ground to Satan to openly attack the Throne of God as it is made real in the experience of all of God's children through the Spirit. In the Bible, there is an entity...a body of people...known to raise a fist to attack the Throne of God in this universe: Amalek.</strong> And by the Lord's sovereign grace and mercy, I have had opportunity to live under the influence of not just any Amalekite...this corporate person is Amalekite royalty...she is a princess of the Amalekites...being so wealthy, so proud, and so sensitive of how she is made to appear before her own people.</p>

<p>Because I don't want to end on a down note, there is spiritual significance in how the victory over Amalek was won by God's people. Due to space and time I will just insert a quote from a footnote in my Recovery Version Bible (Exo. Footnote 11<sup>1</sup>, Recovery Version): 

	<blockquote>We are victorious over the flesh by eating and drinking Christ as our life supply and by praying with the interceding Christ and putting the flesh to death with Christ as the fighting Spirit.</blockquote>
