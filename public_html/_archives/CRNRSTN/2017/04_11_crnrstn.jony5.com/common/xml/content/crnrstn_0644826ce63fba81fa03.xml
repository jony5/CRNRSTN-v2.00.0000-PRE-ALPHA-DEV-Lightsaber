The expiration timestamp is also sent except that instead of pointing to some time in the future for the cookie to expire, it has been set to a reasonable amount of time (such as 1 hour) that is in the past. <br />
<br />
When a browser receives this request and updates the expiration timestamp of the specified cookie, the browser will then subsequently delete said cookie, because it will be recognized as being expired.<br />
<br />
The <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/deletecookie/" target="_self">deleteCookie()</a> method of the <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/" target="_self">cookie_manager</a> :: class in the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: will perform this act of deletion automatically for any cookie $name that is passed in as the parameter. No expire timestamp is accepted by this method.<br />
<br />
If the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: has been initialized via <a href="../../../classes/crnrstn/initcookieencryption/" target="_self">initCookieEncryption()</a> to apply an encryption layer to the cookie management process, there are special methods for encryption that must be used. See examples and documentation on the following: <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/addencryptedcookie/" target="_self">addEncryptedCookie()</a>, <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/getencryptedcookie/" target="_self">getEncryptedCookie()</a> and <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/deleteencryptedcookie/" target="_self">deleteEncryptedCookie()</a>.<br />
<br />
ProTip: Unencrypted cookies can also be deleted through the invocation of the <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/addcookie/" target="_self">addCookie()</a> method if the expire timestamp has been set to a time in the past.</crnrstn_description><crnrstn_invokingclass>cookie_manager ::</crnrstn_invokingclass><crnrstn_methoddefine>deleteCookie($name)</crnrstn_methoddefine><crnrstn_returnedvalue>TRUE or FALSE</crnrstn_returnedvalue><crnrstn_techspecscontent><crnrstn_techspec>Cookie data is sent as part of the HTTP header, so <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/deletecookie/" target="_self">deleteCookie()</a> must be called before any output is sent to the browser.</crnrstn_techspec><crnrstn_techspec>The <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/deletecookie/" target="_self">deleteCookie()</a> method method sits directly on top of PHP's native setcookie() method.</crnrstn_techspec><crnrstn_techspec>It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of PHP to take advantage of the latests gains in security and processing efficiency.</crnrstn_techspec><crnrstn_techspec>Cookies that have been created with <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/addencryptedcookie/" target="_self">addEncryptedCookie()</a> must be deleted by either calling <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/deleteencryptedcookie/" target="_self">deleteEncryptedCookie()</a> or <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/deleteallcookies/" target="_self">deleteAllCookies()</a>. <br />

This is because the cookie $name which is required by this method...such as "rememberLogin"...will have become internally obfuscated with checksum and cipher information to become some uninterpretable string.</crnrstn_techspec><crnrstn_techspec>Currently tested on an ubuntu 4.2 server running PHP Version 5.2.6 and Apache 2.2.11</crnrstn_techspec></crnrstn_techspecscontent><crnrstn_parameterscontent><crnrstn_parameter><crnrstn_paramname>$name</crnrstn_paramname><crnrstn_paramrequired>1</crnrstn_paramrequired><crnrstn_paramdefinition>The name of the cookie.</crnrstn_paramdefinition></crnrstn_parameter></crnrstn_parameterscontent><crnrstn_examplescontent><crnrstn_example uri="http://crnrstn.jony5.com/common/html/examples/crnrstn_3e9cf78aafcad8469415.html">3e9cf78aafcad8469415</crnrstn_example></crnrstn_examplescontent></crnrstn_element><meta_datecreated>2017-04-11 02:26:52</meta_datecreated></crnrstn_pagecontent>
