The expiration timestamp is also sent except that instead of pointing to some time in the future for the cookie to expire, it has been set to a reasonable amount of time (such as 1 hour) that is in the past. <br />
<br />
When a browser receives this request and updates the expiration timestamp of the specified cookie, the browser will then subsequently delete said cookie because it will be recognized as being expired.<br />
<br />
The <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/deleteallcookies/" target="_self">deleteAllCookies()</a> method of the <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/" target="_self">cookie_manager</a> :: class in the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: will perform this act of deletion automatically for all cookie data (whether encrypted or not) stored in the $_COOKIE super global. Multi-dimensional cookies of up to 4 dimensions will be processed.<br />
<br />
Remember that cookies are part of the HTTP header, so <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/deleteallcookies/" target="_self">deleteAllCookies()</a> must be called before any output is sent to the browser.<br />
<br />
If the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: has been initialized via <a href="../../../classes/crnrstn/initcookieencryption/" target="_self">initCookieEncryption()</a> to apply an encryption layer to the cookie management process, there are special methods for encryption that must be used. See examples and documentation on the following: <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/addencryptedcookie/" target="_self">addEncryptedCookie()</a>, <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/getencryptedcookie/" target="_self">getEncryptedCookie()</a> and <a href="../../../classes/cookie_manager/deleteencryptedcookie/" target="_self">deleteEncryptedCookie()</a>.</crnrstn_description><crnrstn_invokingclass>cookie_manager ::</crnrstn_invokingclass><crnrstn_methoddefine>deleteAllCookies()</crnrstn_methoddefine><crnrstn_returnedvalue>TRUE</crnrstn_returnedvalue><crnrstn_techspecscontent><crnrstn_techspec>It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of PHP to take advantage of the latests gains in security and processing efficiency.</crnrstn_techspec><crnrstn_techspec>Currently tested on an ubuntu 4.2 server running PHP Version 5.2.6 and Apache 2.2.11</crnrstn_techspec></crnrstn_techspecscontent><crnrstn_parameterscontent></crnrstn_parameterscontent><crnrstn_examplescontent><crnrstn_example uri="http://crnrstn.jony5.com/common/html/examples/crnrstn_a271f2b9dd5fd7223ec5.html">a271f2b9dd5fd7223ec5</crnrstn_example></crnrstn_examplescontent></crnrstn_element><meta_datecreated>2017-04-11 02:26:52</meta_datecreated></crnrstn_pagecontent>
