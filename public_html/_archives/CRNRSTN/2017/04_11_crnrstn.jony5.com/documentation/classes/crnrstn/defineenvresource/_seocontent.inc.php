<div class="hidden"><h1>defineEnvResource()</h1>
		<p>The successful initialization of the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: to the hosting environment depends very much on the parameters passed through the <a href="../../../classes/crnrstn/defineenvresource/" target="_self">defineEnvResource()</a> method. Specifically, if the $_SERVER parameters are off (e.g. due to reversed slashes or neglect of case-sensitivity), the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: will not initialize with the correct environment...if any. <br />
<br />
Outside of the predefined server config parameters contained within the $_SERVER super global, the <a href="../../../classes/crnrstn/defineenvresource/" target="_self">defineEnvResource()</a> method can be used to define any number of resources of interest for the purpose of providing access to said resources to the application through the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite ::. WSDL end-points, Wordpress(r) config. values (if running Wordpress(r) on top of C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN), links to 3rd party resources, analytics/tracking service IDs and of course paths to local assets relative to the application are just a few of the kinds of parameters which may be environmentally relative.</p>
