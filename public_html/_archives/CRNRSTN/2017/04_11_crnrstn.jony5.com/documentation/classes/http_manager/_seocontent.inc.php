<div class="hidden"><h1>http_manager</h1>
		<p>The C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: also comes equipped with an <a href="../../../documentation/classes/http_manager/" target="_self">http_manager</a> :: class providing access to common HTTP related request handling operations. When an application uses C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN as the foundation for all of its HTTP request handling, the light weight methods for extracting and/or evaluating GET and POST request data allow for the easy application of security and data handling protocols...application wide...from one source. <br />
<br />
For example, a layer of protection from malicious attacks via certain forms of injection can be applied globally via customizing the <a href="../../../documentation/classes/http_manager/extractdata/" target="_self">extractData()</a> method to sanitize all data coming in through GET or POST request. By default, <a href="../../../documentation/classes/http_manager/extractdata/" target="_self">extractData()</a> applies a trim() to all requests, and this can be customized with more stringent sanitization rules or even removed if desired.<br />
<br />
In the example below, data for the HTTP $_POST request method type is being channelled through a switch "gate keeper" so that the appropriate handling can be applied. For simplicity, a single case-study...user authentication...is shown, but one could easily insert additional case statements in order to process every request of a similar nature (i.e. $GET or $_POST) across an entire site.</p>
