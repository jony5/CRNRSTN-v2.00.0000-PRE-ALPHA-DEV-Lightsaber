<div class="hidden"><h1>issetParam()</h1>
		<p>When checking on the overall status of HTTP data, the <a href="../../../classes/http_manager/issethttp/" target="_self">issetHTTP()</a> method of the <a href="../../../classes/http_manager/" target="_self">http_manager</a> :: class will return TRUE or FALSE depending on the existence of data in the request method type. This method accepts only a single parameter...the $_GET or $_POST super global. <br />
<br />
For a more granular approach to determining the availability of $_POST or $_GET data, the <a href="../../../classes/http_manager/issetparam/" target="_self">issetParam()</a> method of the <a href="../../../classes/http_manager/" target="_self">http_manager</a> :: class will return TRUE or FALSE depending on the availability of data within the specified HTTP request method type ($_GET or $_POST).<br />
<br />
The <a href="../../../classes/http_manager/issetparam/" target="_self">issetParam()</a> method...which is being documented here..., requires one additional parameter...the $name of the variable that is being stored in the super global.</p>
