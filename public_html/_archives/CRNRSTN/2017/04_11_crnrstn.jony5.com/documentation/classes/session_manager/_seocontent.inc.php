<div class="hidden"><h1>session_manager</h1>
		<p>Within the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite ::, the functionality associated with session management is an integral component. Although the successful configuration of C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN may not be dependent upon the PHP SESSION, in order to gain efficiencies in runtime operation, the obvious benefit of PHP SESSION state management is fully capitalized upon in order to persist information that C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN would otherwise need to continuously re-evaluate and bringing with this unnecessary repetition the added side-effect...understandably...of degrading the applications' performance.<br />
<br />
Once an environmental configuration within C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN has been selected, the "#winning" profile is immediately associated with the running PHP SESSION, and all other potential environmental profiles are discarded. On subsequent requests, the PHP SESSION is checked for consistency of integrity to ensure that the state of connectivity has not changed (e.g. transition from VPN to public network), and if all is well, the request will be handled accordingly.<br />
<br />
When <a href="../../../documentation/classes/crnrstn/initsessionencryption/" target="_self">initSessionEncryption()</a> has been invoked within the configuration file to configure C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN for encryption, this encryption layer (which C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN leverages for the management of its own internal affairs) will also be exposed to the application developer through...primarily...two (2) methods of the <a href="../../../documentation/classes/session_manager/" target="_self">session_manager</a> :: class object. Therefore, throughout the application...the invocation of both <a href="../../../documentation/classes/session_manager/setsessionparam/" target="_self">setSessionParam()</a> and <a href="../../../documentation/classes/session_manager/getsessionparam/" target="_self">getSessionParam()</a> will push and pull data through the encrypt/decrypt layer which will have been configured within the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite::.</p>
