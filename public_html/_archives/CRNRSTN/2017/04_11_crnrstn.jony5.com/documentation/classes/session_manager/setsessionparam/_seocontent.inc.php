<div class="hidden"><h1>setSessionParam()</h1>
		<p>If data within an application needs to be persisted together with the users' PHP SESSION, invoking <a href="../../../classes/session_manager/setsessionparam/" target="_self">setSessionParam()</a> will send that information to the SESSION...passing it through the encryption layer of the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: per the configuration settings of the same. Because the mcrypt ciphers require the data targeted for encryption to be of string data type, certain data types including objects, arrays, boolean will be stored in SESSION just as it was received...sans encryption. Integers, float (or double) and...of course...string data types are able to be processed by the mcrypt ciphers.</p>
