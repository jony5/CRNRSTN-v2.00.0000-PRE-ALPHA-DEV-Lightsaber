<div class="hidden"><h1>getSessionParam()</h1>
		<p>Data stored to a users PHP SESSION via the invocation of <a href="../../../classes/session_manager/setsessionparam/" target="_self">setSessionParam()</a> can subsequently be extracted through <a href="../../../classes/session_manager/getsessionparam/" target="_self">getSessionParam()</a>. Due to the fact that the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: uses a system of checksums and encryption to handle storage and retrieval of PHP SESSION data, information that was not pushed into SESSION via the <a href="../../../classes/session_manager/" target="_self">session_manager</a> :: class with its appropriate methods will not be able to be accessed through the invocation of the same.<br />
<br />
Because the mcrypt ciphers require the data targeted for encryption to be of string data type, certain data types including objects, arrays, boolean will be stored in SESSION just as it was received...sans encryption. Integers, float (or double) and...of course...string data types are able to be processed by the mcrypt ciphers.</p>
