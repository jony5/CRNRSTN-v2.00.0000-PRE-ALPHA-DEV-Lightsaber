<div class="hidden"><h1>__construct()</h1>
		<p>Inspired by the NuSOAP WDSLCLIENT4.PHP sample file, the <a href="../../../classes/soap_manager/" target="_self">soap_manager</a> :: class of the C<span class="the_R">R</span>NRSTN Suite :: sits directly on top of the NuSOAP (0.9.5) PHP Toolkit for web services (SOAP server/client) support and development. When the <a href="../../../classes/soap_manager/" target="_self">soap_manager</a> class is instantiated, an instance of a NuSOAP web services client (within the constructor of the soap_manager) will be created as well. This can be customized for different SOAP client (or connection) types as needed.</p>
