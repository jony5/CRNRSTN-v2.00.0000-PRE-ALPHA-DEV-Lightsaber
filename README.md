# CRNRSTN-v2.00.0000-PRE-ALPHA-DEV-Lightsaber
A significant refactoring of CRNRSTN ::. This is hot in the works...with ~60% of refactoring complete.



## Production

The SITE IS DOWN at this time. Hosting migration is in progress --> [lightsaber.crnrstn.evifweb.com](http://lightsaber.crnrstn.evifweb.com/) [off-site development backup] Sadly...serving as such...for now...so errors can be expected. 

It's taking too long (there are entire days when I can do nothing) to get a stable build to complete this deep link integration with documentation.

[Click here](https://lightsaber.crnrstn.jony5.com/_tmp_diagrams/) for temp diagrams that are being used for decision making now.
