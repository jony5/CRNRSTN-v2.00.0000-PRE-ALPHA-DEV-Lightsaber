I dropped my Bible in this night, and a relationship photo fell out of Ezekiel Chapter 1.

In 2014, my brother in Christ, Jermaine Holloway, gave this picture to me saying, "...for you, little brother", and I put it into my Bible because the bond in the picture is as special to me as my big[sic] brother...even to 2023.

Also, Jermaine told me he was a new grandfather. Soooo,...I never said, "send my congrats to April".
