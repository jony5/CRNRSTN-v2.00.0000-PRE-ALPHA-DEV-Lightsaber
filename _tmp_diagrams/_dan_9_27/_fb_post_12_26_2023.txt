In ~2010, the gov't did the same to me one night, and 
I wanted to have sex with this random girl that I walked 
home from Octane Coffee sooo bad.

I was also really drunk.
At this girls apartment across from slice pizza/la fondas, 
a wave of passion overcame me, and I asked this woman (that 
I did not know or even like) repeatedly if she would have 
sex with me, and she kept repeating that she "shouldn't".

So, I just left.

Some tech was used to put the desire to have sex into my 
soul, and I thought that the feeling was of God; the same 
happened to my 935M lady friend (that I still very much 
like), and the bloke, Jermaine Holloway, was told not to 
pull out of her after he finished raping her.

This is for sure rape...but, it is rape with 
technology...not rape with drugs like alcohol or something.

My lady, M, should get all custody, and people should go 
to jail for this. Whoever "jokingly"[?] told my brother 
not to pull out should definitely see jail; was this Obama?

I will stand to be corrected if my friend, M, did not get 
pregnant via a strong team effort by obama, my dad, my 
mother, and my brother between 2011 and 2014.
